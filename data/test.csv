cim286,"Today my wife and I had a pretty big fight about me not supporting her dream of being a YouTube star. 

Her channel, which has one video, is going to be comprised of her making paintings, talking about her experience being pregnant, and DIY projects.

I generally wouldn't care, she can do whatever she wants as a hobby. Which in fact was the comment that triggered this blow out fight- my contention is that she will use this new endeavor to do less as a part of the family. 

As I said earlier, she is newly pregnant and because she is pregnant she has said that she can't cook anymore. Cooking was her one responsibility around the house. I take care of all of the yard work, finances, repairs, dishes, general maintenance, shopping, laundry, and am working finishing up a large renovation to our sunroom. Normally I don't mind, I enjoy listening to audio books and getting work done. I work from home 2 days a week, and am fortunate enough to be able to do laundry during work hours.

Recently she decided that she would start an online boutique - to which I supported and funded. She spent a few weekends developing her logo and buying stuff before she gave up. During that time she refused to help me with the occasional thing that required two people (i.e. hanging a fence) because she was too busy. Mind you she was watching TV with her computer open on the couch. But in her defense she took care of making meals (Hello Fresh) and that's all I asked of her.

The YouTube thing really strikes me at the core, I really don't like that whole subculture of YouTube celebrities. I don't have a real reason why, but my best guess is that I hate how much time my wife spends watching these silly videos ""vlogs"". 

AITA for being unsupportive of her dream to make money as a YouTube star? Or am I fair in holding my ground in being accommodating to it as a hobby ?


TLDR: My wife wants to be a YouTube star. I support her doing it as a hobby but not as a task that she uses as an excuse to not contribute.

Edit: Thank you for the support and feedback, it have me the confidence to hold my ground and have a long talk last night. The conversation went well and she seemed receptive to my criticism and offered to assume the cleaning responsibilities that didn't involve chemicals (dusting, vacuuming, etc.)- which I will consider a win.

The most difficult part of the conversation was me being quite direct about the idea of her being a YouTube star. I can't say it was the easiest conversation to have, but I will say that my understanding was skewed. She said that she understands that it is highly unlikely that she will make a dime doing this, and under no circumstance will she quit her job to pursue this dream- unless by chance she happens to be making more on YouTube. Which she acknowledges is unlikely.  

As quite a few suggested, we scheduled an appointment with a Marriage Councillor and are going to join an newly wed small group at our church.","NTA - she sounds like her priorities are really skewed, and pregnant people cook all the time. Maybe in the last month it could be an issue, but not for most of the time. She's lazy and not doing her equal part. Whether you're married or not, when you live with others, you help out.

Edit: early pregnancy seems to be the worst time, so my bad on that. However, in general, if that's actually the only thing she did, yeah, bad partner.",[deleted],0,0

drheec,"little bit of info, this is a thraway, im a 2nd yr (19M) uni student, and I have an 8am lab on monday.

Backstory\~

This happened last monday. I wont even lie, I looked like a fuckin bum, I came to class after just waking up, I brushed my teeth, and went to class. My hair was really messy and it looked like a just woke up.

The TA teaching the lab is a 4th yr student, the first thing she said when I walked in was ""ohhhh boy"".

I chuckled and sat down.

The whole class was basically her berating the way I looked, and clearly I wasn't ""dressing to impress""

I told her I will dress the way I want, and she can dress she wants.

She told me not to bother showing up dressed like a bum next class cus she wouldn't let me in.

Today I walked up to the door, and it was locked. She came up to the window of the door, took a look at my outfit, and walked away from the door.

My buddy was in the class, so he opened the door. I sat down and now she's saying she won't start the lab until I leave.

I honestly wouldn't care, but the lab gives u 5% for just going for attendance. I told her I am not leaving, and she said to stop being such a jerk, according to her- I'm lowering the morale and just an overall eyesore to the people around me. AITA for dressing this way? I feel like it's just her power tripping over nothing.","NTA, that is extremely unprofessional on the member of staffs part. You’re entitled to dress however the heck you want.  I’m in my 4th year of uni and if one of my lab technicians judged my outfit and refused to let me learn I’d be both upset and very pissed off. You’re presumably paying a lot of money to go to uni and for her to bluntly refuse to teach you based on your outfit is so rude and unprofessional. She’s the asshole not you","

bu3tfu,"Okay some backstory. I’m 32M and my little brother is 19. My parents lost custody when they went to prison (thats a whole other thing) so I was his legal guardian for a number of years.

I bought him a new WRX as a gift for getting a 4.0 in high school. Technically the car is mine, it’s in my name, I pay the insurance, etc, so I know it was legal for me to do it. Anyway, he goes off to college and gets a DUI driving the car, so I sold it to pay for his legal expenses and pocketed the rest. Some of my friends think that is too harsh and that I should have only taken it for a while. At the time I was mad af but now I’m worried that I went a bit overboard and jeopardized our future relationship.

AITA?","NTA

He didn't get a ticket, he got a DUI.  Totally justified; particularly a performance car.

There is nothing saying you can't get his something more practical later on when he proves he is mature enough not to drink and drive.  But in the meantime it sounds like he should be Ubering it anyway.",You did the right thing. Taking it away isn’t a good idea since he could find the keys,0,1
e8f64n,"Brief background. My sister and she were friends for decades. My sister passed two years ago. Her best friend is LITERALLY sleeping at my mom's 2-3 days at a time. 

I'm not over my sister's passing. That happens when you don't get to say goodbye, or I'm sorry. Or I love you. So, even if I am the asshole, go tell a family member that you love them. You don't know when it'll be too late to do it. 

We're celebrating by going to the Getty Villa. I thought it was just going to be my mom, me, my little sister, and my little sister's kids. Turns out Best Friend is going. 

Best friend has tons of drama, and that's coming from someone who also has lots of goddamn drama. She lives in Los Vegas, so she drives down to San Bernadino every 2 to 3 days, and stays with my mom 2 to 3 days, then goes home. Edit: That trip she takes is in my mom's car. Pays for gas, and that's it. She's started calling my mom ""Mom"" and her son calls my mom ""Grandma"". The kid is 12. Best friend had a shit home life, undoubtedly. But it seems like she's clinging to my mom because there's a hole in my mom's life without my sister. 

Anytime I invite my mom out, she'll say we have to bring Best Friend, because she needs someone to watch her. She's 45. She doesn't need watching. 

I feel like this trip is my last goddamn straw. We can't do ANYTHING but that this chick is there. I lost a sister, I'm not trying to replace her. My mom even ASKED me how I felt about her being around all the time, so I told her the truth, it's irritating. She's IRRITATING. Really loud, and very abrasive. Come to think of it, she really was like my sister.

I want us to just have a family thing. The family I grew up with, my mom, my sisters, and me, no hangers-on. 

My sister and me, we were treated pretty badly by my mom, so our experiences were shared. I feel like every time this girl opens her mouth about my sister, I want to scream at her that she didn't know my sister. She was one of the people who didn't show up to my sister's 16th birthday party. I remember that. My sister had NO friends on her birthday. 

I feel like my mom needs her around, though. Like maybe if the best friend hangs around, it'll be like my sister didn't die. 

I dunno. I already feel like an asshole. I mean, I am an asshole. A lot. But I don't want to believe I'm an asshole because I don't want my sister to be replaced.","NAH

Mourn in whatever way makes sense to you. If doing this with the friend doesn't work for you, don't go. No need to explain yourself, just don't go.

I would urge you to consider that everyone else is also allowed to mourn in ways that make sense to them. You also don't have a monopoly on having loved your sister. This friend may have loved her just as deeply. She may be annoying as fuck, but don't assume that she didn't have a real relationship with your sister and isn't mourning as well.","You're NTA for feeling that way, and your mom sounds like a piece of work. 

IDK about the birthday though. I get that you don't want the friend around, but there must be other times for you to make a stand. This has the potential to hurt the rest of the family, without you changing anyone's mind.",3,0
db44rf,"I live in a city where houses are very close. I'm talking, a strong wind could have you smelling the bodily winds of your neighbor.

I walked over to see if I could talk to someone; no one there. I made a 45 second video of the unattended site . I rang her doorbell, nothing.

acleon,"So I’m incredibly conflicted about this, and created an account for my first actual reddit post ever just to get some clarity from you all.

 I’m a 28 year old male, and have been dating my current GF(25F) for about a year now. Before she and I met, a close group of friends and myself have been trying to plan a cabin ski trip together. One of those things that we’ve been talking about doing for about two years, but just couldn’t ever find a date that works for everyone. It’s been kind’ve an ongoing conversation for us, and we FINALLY decided to book a cabin for this February.

A few weeks ago, my GF tells me that she just got the official invite for a wedding that she is a bridesmaid in. Turns out, she was invited with a plus one, which she didn’t initially expect. (EDIT: a lot of people seem confused about this...she knew about this wedding for over a year, and did not know she would have a plus one. She thought she would be invited alone until the invite came in the mail 2 months before the wedding). Do I want to go? Of course I do! Except, as we talk about it more, we piece together that it is the same weekend that my friends and I have already booked the cabin for our trip. It’s too late to change the dates, but I would only be out about $100 for my share of the cost if I bail. My friends would be bummed, but there’s about 13 people going on the trip so the group dynamic doesn’t really change that much with or without me.

Since I know this would mean a lot to the GF, my first instinct is that I want to go to the wedding with her. I agree to bail on the trip. My friends and I all live in the same city, so even though our busy lives are making it harder to stay close, it’s not like we don’t ever get the opportunity to see eachother.

As a couple days go by though, I start to realize how much I wanted to go on this trip. We had been planning it for so long, and I was really looking forward to it. On top of that, I learn a few things about the wedding: 1) The only person she knows at this wedding is the bride (a former sorority sister of hers). Even though they were close in college, they’ve grown a bit apart and no longer have any close mutual friends. I was initially under the impression that this would be my first opportunity to be introduced to most of her long time friends which is part of why I wanted to go. 2) She is a bridesmaid in the wedding. Which means that for most of the weekend, she will have bridesmaid responsibilities to attend to. Makeup, pictures, rehearsal, etc.....So I would barely even be with her all weekend. The wedding has one of those head tables for the bridal party, so on the day of the wedding I literally wouldn’t be with her all day until after dinner at the reception (side note....i hate this concept any time I’m a groomsman #freedomforbridalparties). 3) SHE DOES NOT EVEN WANT TO GO TO THE WEDDING. She’s been dreading it apparently. Been going through some things in her personal life, was in a car accident and is experiencing some lingering (but manageable) pain, and apparently feels like she and the bride aren’t even friends anymore. Physically, and emotionally, she just doesn’t want to travel and dedicate a whole weekend to this wedding. But she agreed to be a bridesmaid a year ago, so she is powering through it, and thinks having me there will make it so much better (again, she won’t even have me with her for about 2/3 of the day)

So a couple days after agreeing, I asked her if she had RSVP’d us yet. She hadn’t. I explained that I was having second thoughts and asked how she felt about me going on my friend trip instead. She was not very pleased. Told me she felt like I was abandoning her, and that she is hurt that I don’t want to be there for her. It will also apparently make it even worse for her at the wedding knowing that I’m with friends having fun while she’s miserable. Gives me the old, “if you feel like your trip is more important, then I guess there’s nothing I can do” or something along those lines. I don’t have much patience for passive aggression, or thinly veiled guilt trips, so I told her that I’m not going to the wedding.

After a couple weeks, she just finally let it go, after giving herself a major pat on the back for being “so understanding”. And making sure I knew that “she has every right to be a lot more pissed off than she is”. I still feel like I am in the right here, but I need some help.....AITA?

EDIT:
tl;dr - I’ve been planning a ski trip with friends for two years, that my gf wants me to bail on it for a wedding she invited me to on two months notice","YTA, but just barely. I would say it's more because you backed out after you said yes, then because you backed out. She probably got her hopes up that a shitty and uncomfortable weekend was going to be less shitty, and now she's by herself. I would see if her plus one can be a close friend, or something like that just so she's not alone. I would also make sure you keep up communication during the event so she knows you're still thinking of her. ","NTA I think you're allowed to have second thoughts, and the fact that you asked if she'd RSVP'd *before* you told her you were having second thoughts goes a long way in talking about it respectfully.

Granted personally I'd have gone with the girlfriend. Sure 2/3 of the time you won't even be together, but it's the 1/3 that she has access to you that matters. The window for you to fill that emotional need is small, but it's there.",1,0
cd05da,"I was in a domestic violence relationship and I left him in 2016, and soon after, I obtained a 3 year restraining order against him.

Because of this whole experience (after quite some time of healing, treatment and recovery from the trauma) I decided to pursue a career in helping survivors of domestic violence. I began volunteering at a nonprofit organization in a large metropolitan area that offers services to survivors, and I was hired as staff this year. I love my job and it’s my passion.

Part of the volunteer work I did involved being stationed at police stations so you can help survivors who walk in seeking services or responding out with officers to domestic violence crime scenes. I spent many hours at these stations and I became very friendly with some of the officers I worked with; and they knew my backstory.  During this time, my ex was in jail on identity theft charges, and I had always been super paranoid of that because he had taken cards out in my name using my information.

One officer who was pretty senior and laid back asked me what my abusive ex’s name was so he could look him up and see what was going on with his custody status and to give me peace of mind.
It listed his information but I didn’t take it down or anything, I was just mainly concerned if he was still in jail or not for my financial security and physical safety. My job has advised us not to ask officers to look up this kind of information as to not put them in an awkward position.

My restraining order expires next month and I need to renew it, but I do not have my ex’s address so he can be served the papers. I have no contact with his family or friends, and I attempted to ask my county’s probation department if they could serve it to him because he’s on probation, but they informed me I have to find out his address in order for an officer to serve him. 

WIBTA if I asked this officer to find out my ex’s address so I can serve him the renewal papers? Or am I crossing a boundary with both the police and my job?","YTA. 

That would be crossing a huge boundary, it's often very not good for anyone who works with people's information in any capacity to go around giving it out to anyone. Even pizza delivery people can't give out your address to anyone outside the store. For police, it can be super extra not good. 

Not saying that one wouldn't if you asked, people sometimes act dumb, but the asking should not happen

It would ok for you to ask about how to get these papers served without an address and see if they can give you any advice, guidance, or good contacts, but this can come across as asking for the address indirectly and look bad, so make that social judgement call.

/r/legaladvice may be able to help you with that info also, if you don't want to risk looking like you're trying to ask for the address indirectly.","do what you have to do in order to keep yourself safe.  Especially from a criminal.

e6sdgy,"Some backstory: growing up my parents loved to brag about how I was a live in baby sitter for my younger siblings. I wasn’t allowed to go out on the weekends or do after school activities because I needed to be on call for any potential babysitting needs. I was even forced to stay home from HS if their elementary school had a snow day and miss lessons and exams to babysit. This got to be really stressful as a teen, but if I ever protested I was told it was my obligation as the oldest. I never questioned it (I’m very introverted). 

Fast forward to now: I’m in my late 20s, married, live in my own house and have my own family. My parents call me to TELL me they need me to come over and babysit. Not ask, Demand. They tell me I need to be there at such and such time. My car is currently at the shop so I’m relying on my husband bringing me everywhere. And I have an infant of my own. I tell them I can’t because he’s working and won’t be home until midnight. They start getting MAD at me, telling me that they did everything for me and the least I can do is help them out for once in my life. I’m LIVID, and start snapping back that I’m done being their slave and I’m tired of being treated like another parent to my siblings. 

It’s been a few days and I’ve calmed down, now I feel like garbage as they have been ignoring me. I feel like I should admit that I was wrong and apologizing for not helping them out when they needed it because after all they are my family.
But I also don’t want to back down and go back to being treated like a rug... I just need some opinions on whether IWTA or not.,, thanks in advance","NTA at all!!!
Your parents sound dreadful. If you don’t have a lot of experience telling them no, start by eliminating your excuses/explanations. It doesn’t matter if your car is in the shop. 
“Oh, I’m so sorry but I can’t”
“Oh no, I’m unavailable”
“I think you might want to look for another sitter” 

Repeat a million times, in a friendly voice. I’m only suggesting the friendly voice because it sounds like telling them no is new for you and sometimes it’s easier to ease in to it. Good luck!","Yeah, NTA. You have your own family. It doesn't even matter if you are their child watching your siblings, it should not be an obligation but a favor to your parents. They need to figure out their lives and stop thinking you will just be at their back and call. Do not appologize for having your own family that you need to care for (your own infant needs you for everything right now).",0,0
9z8ivm,"So I work a job where I walk a lot.  I'm also a cheap bastard that buys cheap shoes at Walmart. I wear these shoes everyday to work and also when exercising.  As you could guess, they leave quite a stench when I get home, pop them off, and relax. I can smell them stinking up the room right now but I really don't mind it much.

So here's the issue, I live with my girlfriend and she hates my stinky feet.  She gets home from work about an hour after I get home (schedule varies), and once the waft of my feet hits her nose, she demands I wash my feet.  Here's the thing though; I feel for her, I really do.  I would wash my feet but I'm tired when I get home and I just want to relax.  Washing my feet requires me to prop up my foot in the bathroom sink and do some one-legged acrobatics while I scrub between the toes.  I don't always have the energy for that but I also hate bothering her with my stink feet.

Sometimes I do it, and sometimes I don't.  I mean it's stinky at first but then I get use to it, I just wanna sit down and watch some Yu-Gi-Oh man, so AITA?

Edit: Well my self esteem is shot but at least I'm motivated to wash my feet now ._.

auaq35,"I live with two roommates. I go to school full time and have classes everyday starting from 8 am that go all the way into the afternoon, and on top of that I also have night classes. On the days I have night classes, I tend to stay there even after my day classes are finished because I carpool with my best friend, AND its a 30 min drive from my school to my home and I don't like going back and forth because my car's a bit of a gas guzzler. When I'm not at school, I'm at work which my shifts basically start from almost right when I get out of school all the way to late at night, Roommate 1 is unemployed and always at the house, and Roommate 2 does work and have school, but he tends to still have more free time at the house than I do.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I understand that I should be pitching in more to do chores like taking trash out and cleaning the bathroom because I DO use those things the few times I am home. But I rarely eat at home let alone even use any dishes because I don't eat at home. I usually eat at either school or work, and the few rare times I do eat at home I eat these frozen power bowls that come with their OWN bowls and use my portable utensils when I eat them (because if I don't consistently use them I'll forget about them, it sounds dumb I know but it's just how it is for me.) I also have depression which tends to make me a little complacent, I won't lie, but usually I'm on top of chores.

&amp;#x200B;

I just recently just took a trip that lasted for about half a week and came back a few days ago. I was at the store with one of my roommates, when suddenly he piped up and said, ""Roommate 2 says you need to start doing chores more."" I told him sure, but what about the dishes since I'm never home and use them? From there it turned into a huge argument and us going back and forth with him saying ""well, you live here and it doesn't matter if you don't use them you need to do them anyways"" and me arguing back ""if I never use them I'm basically just cleaning up after you two and that isn't fair"".

&amp;#x200B;

And the thing is, is that this isn't even the first time we haven't seen eye to eye in the house, and I don't like saying anything about it because Roommate 2 gets fussy back and then him and I will end up fighting. The last instance was when THEIR dog had been chewing my stuff up for MONTHS since I had first moved in and all Roommate 2 would say is, ""Don't leave your stuff on the floor"". After months of doing that, the dog would still find ways to chew my shit up and would chew up quite expensive things of mine too, including my glasses and shoes. When I brought this to attention, we got into a fight because all he said ""just don't let her in your room"", which was hard because every morning he would open the room door to let her in. He wouldn't even compensate me.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to know if I'm in the wrong for the whole dishes thing, or maybe even both instances, because I'm tired of feeling singled out.

&amp;#x200B;","NTA.  You're *roommates* not family, you do your own dishes. Basic things like keeping the floor clean, dusting, etc. should be shared.  Otherwise, your mess is is your responsibility.","

efszee,My mom decided to inform me that her and my stepdad were going to grill out and have a get together on Christmas day. She told me about this on the 23rd and asked if I could bring a side dish or two so I agreed to bring potato salad and some mac and cheese for the kiddos. She said oh no kids its adults only. I was a little taked aback but ok whatever. I told her I'll see if my MIL isnt busy but since its Christmas day I doubt I'd find a sitter and just left it at that. The next day shes texting me asking if I had a sitter and what time we would expect to get there I told her I wasnt sure if I could even come yet since I didnt for sure have a babysitter. I got in touch with my MIL but well its Christmas and they have a dinner to go to so I have no baby sitter. Kinda bummed but trying to make the best of it I suggest that we come and only stay to eat and visit for about an hour. She told me no because no one would be happy with my toddler around and my toddler wouldn't be happy either. I was pretty upset so I told her that nevermind we will just stay home and spend Christmas with our daughter since they wouldnt be happy with her and it would be such an inconvenience for her to be around them for less than 2 hours because we dont have a baby sitter and with it being Christmas freaking day everyone is busy with their families. She told me she was sorry I felt that way and she hoped i wasn't mad at her. I responded that i wasnt mad just really disappointed to which she responded that they had all agreed no kids. I was never a part of the planning and if I would have been I'd have told her that it wouldn't be possible for me to make it if i wasn't allowed to bring my daughter. I told her this but she had no response other than a few texts and suggesting we find a paid sitter (seriously its Christmas and were broke from buying presents plus who tf wants to babysit on Christmas day?) saying we still had time to fgure out a way to make it with out our daughter. I ignored those and woke up Christmas morning to several messages saying she had talked it over with everyone and it would be ok of I brought my daughter so what time will we be there and am I bringing the sides I agreed to.

e63211,"So my friends are getting married today! As I (f22) and my boyfriend (22) were sitting on the couch this morning, we realized we had both forgotten to buy a wedding gift. Neither of us have a ton of money (or any to spare, for that matter).

I figured it would be okay for us to forego a gift, at least for right now, given that our friends are also pretty lacking-in-funds and I’m sure that they’d understand. Their wedding is super small and low key. The ceremony is taking place in the living room of the bride’s family home and the reception will be held over a backyard barbecue. I was told I could wear sweatpants if I REALLY wanted to (not that I plan to). I’m perfectly okay with splurging on a gift but I’d rather wait until I get my paycheck in two days. I’d rather choose a gift that’s specifically for them, instead of just a last minute “let’s pick something from the kitchen” thing. 

My boyfriend is insistent that we present them with a gift TODAY because he feels like we owe the groom a debt of gratitude. He let both of us live in his house (this as before we got together and for our own individual reasons; bf and I started dating partially as a result of living in that house together).

Bf’s solution is that we give them the bottle of bourbon that I bought for the two of us to enjoy. I don’t want to give this away because I spent my own money on it, and we live in a dry county so it’s a bit of a pain to go out and replace it. I specifically picked the bourbon because I know my bf likes that kind, so I don’t want him to give it away since I chose it for him. It is currently unopened.

As bf was talking on the phone with another wedding attendant, I heard him talking about gifts and what he should bring. He said something like “I want to give them this bottle of alcohol we have but u/definitelynotapariah is being a bitch right now so...”

AITA for not wanting to give away the bottle of bourbon?","NAH/ESH?  On one hand, it's your bourbon.   On the other hand, it's a party, so bourbon.   On the gripping hand, BF says totally assholish thing on phone.

Know who the real asshole here is?  The dry county that makes picking up a bottle of bourbon a hassle.

c76v9p,"My parents are pretty wealthy. 

I’m 26 and from 21-25 I was in and out of rehabs. I was abusing so many different kinds of drugs and I wasted so much money. I OD’d once  and it destroyed my family to watch me go through that. 

I am intensely ashamed of who I was as a person and I have been sober for almost a year. 

My parents are now approaching their late 60s and have started finalizing their wills and inheritance. 

Yesterday they sat me down and told me that I will not be getting any of the inheritance as they don’t trust me not to relapse with all that money suddenly in my possession and as a result my siblings will be getting my share of the money. 

I was pretty upset about this and I said that they were going to make my siblings rich while I would get nothing from it and that wasn’t fair. I was almost yelling at this point. 

They told me to calm down but I was too upset to listen and I left. I called my brother and sister after I left and told them what my parents said and they said that it was their choice and there wasn’t anything they could do. 

I accused them of just wanted all the money for themselves and not caring about what happened to me. 

Today I have my dad texting me that they are worried about me and “disappointed in my behaviour yesterday.” I talked to my sponsor and he said that while anger is understandable, I have to do everything in my power not to ruin the trust I’ve built with my family over the past year and acting like an asshole addict won’t help. 
Sometimes I still have trouble with my reactions to things now that I’m sober however I don’t feel as though I’m entirely unjustified here. 

AITA for getting upset?","YTA because you probably spent your share of the inheritance every time they tried to help you. Seriously add up every dollar they've spent on your addiction, or ask them to add it up, and then ask yourself if you deserve any more.","NTA. I wish I could understand exactly where you are, but I haven’t walked the path of recovery. But I definitely understand the reaction you’re having. You’re doing everything in your power to not become that old person again and you feel like they don’t trust the transformation. That they don’t trust you. 

On one hand, I can’t blame them. But I also wish they could trust and have faith in the person you’ve become and want to be. 

I don’t think you’re the asshole for feeling the way you are but I think your sponsor is right. And I think you need to tread lightly with your family. Maybe if you keep working at the new you - the real you - they could change their minds in the future. Maybe your siblings will share the money after your parents are gone. Only time will tell. 

I wish I could give better advice/opinions, but I’m certainly proud of you for kicking the habit, for what it’s worth. Keep up the good work.",1,0

So about 6 months ago my sister(cheli) did the AncestryDNA test, when she got the test back no one one my dads side was listed as a match. So a few weeks later someone messaged her stating that they were matched as 1st cousins, but they live in California and we are in New York. My mom used to work as an EMT all through our our childhood, so the 1st cousin said she had 1 relative that lived..... right over by us and worked at the same ambulance company. She said the name and we remembered him exactly. But he had passed away. We confront my mom and she started crying that she was “taken advantage of” .... yeah right ma ... she admitted it was one time and she never thought anything and that the guy was sterile. 
        My sister buys me and my older sister (Jen) the kit as a joke. We took it and the results came back. We are all together going through the matches and bam, all of my dads relatives are on my matches. But none on Jens. What are the chances that mom is really that much of a hoe, I mean they had a happy marriage. We never suspected anything. 
        So, I made a joke that at least it’s not the smiths (made up last name) mr Smith was another person at the ambulance company who we grew up around. We played with his kids growing up and his ex wife lived next door to my dad with one of the sons. (Parents divorced about 10 years ago) my sister keeps scrolling and there were 3 matches with his last name. We confront my mom again and she breaks down and locks herself in her bedroom. It was mr Smith. 
          The whole thing is my dad has always been a great father. My one sister has 1 kid and the other has 5, he adores all of them. He gave us all a great life, I told my sisters to never say anything. That is our dad regardless of dna. But they are gossip queens. And are now demanding we sit down to tell my dad. The whole thing is, my mom is a hoe, my dad did nothing wrong. How many times and people were you banging without a condom that you produced 2 different kids. So my dad really only has 1 living child and 2 grandchildren. My little brother passed away a few years ago so who knows. But I told them I refuse to tell him and they are flipping out on me saying it’s their lives

My husbands high school friend lives in our apartment complex and they have an aggressive dog, which they like to sit outside with. Now normally this wouldn’t be a problem, plenty of people in our complex sit outside with their dogs if the weather is nice, but they don’t leash their dog and their dog doesn’t listen to their commands. When I was taking my own dog out to use the bathroom this dog has spotted our pup, ran down a flight of stairs, and ran to our dog barking up a storm and snapping its jaws. Once when my husband was taking him out they actually got into a fight that definitely would’ve gotten worse for our dog since his friends was at least 100 pounds and ours is only about 25-30. And then it happened again a couple days later when we were both out.
 If my husband wasn’t with me i would not have been able to get between them and stop it if anything did happen ,being 29 weeks pregnant and already having no upper body strength. When we had went back inside once his friend actually got control of his dog and ours could potty we were talking about it and i had remembered it happening a long time ago with my ex roommates dog, a dachshund puppy. I told him I was going to report them and he told me to leave it alone and not report them because they were good friends in highschool. 
I went down to the office after he had left for work and told them what happened and that my only problem was that they don’t leash their dog while outside with it and gave them their apartment number.

bs2hls,"I moved into my house 2 years ago and ever since we moved in this tiny super elderly lady who lives with her disabled grandson who is probably 30. Every day her daughter who is probably in her 60s herself comes to pick one of them up, sometimes she's here multiple times a day and she will blow her horn every time. Not a quick toot, she lays on that shit like she waits all day to pull up and piss me off. 

When we first moved in and I started hearing it my first thought maybe they didn't have phones, but it was increasingly irritating ...especially when she pulled up and laid on it for a long time or did it like 5 times before someone came out, but I dealt with it. The other day she sat out there and blew it like 10 times while screaming ""MOM YOUR PHONE IS OFF THE HOOK!"" Until the son came out. So they have phones.

I went online and looked at the Township ordinances and under the section about noise disturbances it stated that it was actually against the ordinance to blow your horn other than to avoid an accident. So yeah, I printed it out and I highlighted the definitions, the ordinance itself, the fines, the exemptions ... all of it. And I waited. 

Today I heard it and had the courage to walk over. The driver was out of the car and the old lady was coming out of the house. I guess I'll do the Reddit dialogue thing lol

Me: Me
OOL: Old old lady
D: Driver

Me: Are you busy?

D: We are about to leave what the hell do you want? 

Me: I live across the street here and every day you pull in and blow your horn and it's very irritating. I actually looked online and it does violate the township ordinance.

D: What are you talking about are you retarded? Honking my horn is illegal?

Me: I've printed and highlighted everything here, I don't want to call anyone on anyone, I just want it to stop. 

D cuts me off: Oh really? Well I bet you live in that junk house and I'll start calling on you for that! 

Me: What junk house!? (Which is stupid because I know which junk house. The house on the end of the street is a total junk house, but idk why she would ever think the horn would bother them down there)

OOL: What is going on? (She was so sweet and cute and I so want nothing to happen to her!) 

D: Nothing mom, this girl is retarded don't worry about it. 

I handed OOL the papers I had printed as D was trying to rush her into the car. D literally ended up getting into the driver seat and started pulling out of the driveway yelling ""GET IN MOM!"" To her 100 year old mother while fucking rolling out of the driveway.

This route felt more mature than any of my other ideas which mostly involved using my children to fuck with her. AITA for what I decided to do?

TLDR; An old lady across the street from me gets picked up every day and the driver blows the horn. I confronted the driver with the township ordinances that back me up. I am in the right, but I don't want the old old lady to get fined and the other lady was pretty old too. I feel guilty.

Edit: She pulled in today after all of this and honked twice. I wasn't home from work yet.","NTA.

av1kv9,"Throwaway, because some of my friends know my main account.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend is currently mad at me and not picking up her phone, so I decided to make a post on here, just to check if I am morally justified in my actions.  


Here´s what happened:  


We (my girlfriend and I) were just hanging out on our phones, when I opened Instagram and the first thing that popped up was a rather revealing picture of a (previously close, now not so close but still in regular contact) female friend of mine. My girlfriend also follows her, and therefore knows that she often posts pictures like these. An argument ensued, as my gf asked me to unfollow her, because it hurts her that I would follow and ""stalk"" (I never visit her profile; I only see her pics in my feed) such a ""slut"". I insisted that following this ""slut"" was not morally wrong, as she and I were friends, and told my girlfriend that she does not get to command me to unfollow friends of mine because she doesn´t like what they post.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I want to clarify that the girl in question has two Instagram accounts, one ""main"" account, where she has a few thousand followers and posts these revealing pictures, and a second account, which is meant for friends only. I follow her on both accounts. 

&amp;#x200B;

The argument went back and forth for a bit, until my girlfriend had to leave my house a few minutes later. She called me later on and told me that even though the girl on Instagram is a friend of mine, I don´t need to follow her main account; it should be enough for me to follow her ""friends-only"" account. I replied that I was morally right to follow her on both accounts, as she is my friend and I want to know what´s going on in her life. We fought a little and she ended up hanging up on me. She´s not answering my calls as of right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I should also mention that I don´t really care about  having access to those ""slutty"" pictures. It´s the principle of the matter (my gf can´t dictate what friends I follow on social media) that´s important to me.

&amp;#x200B;

So, AITA?","NTA

cbyvav,"My friend is turning 29 this year, and just got married. I've never been one to judge her (or anyone) based on her appearance, but recently I've started to notice that she cares less and less about the way she dresses. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, we used to be roommates before she married... and when I would have people over she would walk around in barely there boy shorts, and a silk spaghetti strap top... no bra. Now, in private, I had no issue with this as everyone is allowed their freedom at home, but my parents noticed that she would wear no bra... and would bring it up in conversation sometimes. They even dubbed her ""low hanger"". She's a busty girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Today,  she sends me  pictures of her honeymoon where she went to a safari and fed animals... her entire top of her bra is spilling out of her top.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that women sometimes like to show off their bodies... but tbqh she's on the heavier side... so it just looks plain bad. I have a feeling she might be completely unaware of how ""out of place"" it looks. The only reason why I want to make her aware of this is bc she's having a tough time finding employment, and people often judge her for her appearance (I've had people, one of them being an ex-boss whom I recommended her for the job to, flat out tell me that she dresses like a hooker). 

&amp;#x200B;

a79dwp,"As a preface, my ex-girlfriend and I dated for 5 years. We broke up August  of last year and ended up stop talking to each other altogether at the end of the following October.


My ex recently came out as being a bisexual. This surprised me as she never even hinted towards the fact that she was even as the such. It bothered the absolute crap out of me to know if it was something she had kept a secret from me or not. Not long after I found out, I messaged her asking when she knew this was who she was. Long story short, she was hostile throughout the whole conversation and she ended up saying that she knew for sure for the last 3 years at least.


She said that it wasn't my business, and honestly I wouldn't have pushed so hard if it were with someone that I didn't have so much history with. She also said that the reason she didn't say anything was because I would've made her feel bad. Now I'm not going to sit here and say I was a perfect angel, because I wasn't. It was both of our first relationship and we both made our fair share of mistakes.

ci74gq,"A month or so ago I (21M) volunteered to Chaperone some high school students on a field trip. At the time they had not decided what the field trip was or where we were going. Eventually the high schoolers chose to go to six flags which was around a 2.5 hour drive each way. 

Little bit of context. Six Flags is my gf and my favorite date place. I was afraid she was going to be upset if she knew I was going six flags she would get FOMO or just be jealous and upset that I was going without her. So I had told her that I was going to chaperone students but never said where exactly. I know she is a really smart girl so I removed my snapchat location so she would not see where I was at. This was the deal breaker. She got very upset and refused to talk to me the rest of the day. 

Naturally I was upset the entire time since she wasn't there and that she was mad at me. I just felt horrible, but thought she was going to be less upset if I didn't share where I was. Eventually late at night when we got home I finally told her where I went. She was just upset about the entire thing and said something around the lines of Never being able to trust me again. I still feel crappy to this day, and tears were shed that night as well. Overall really crappy experience.

So what do you think AITA?",YTA. That’s just sketchy behavior. It’s not like you were going there with another girl. You were volunteering your time. She shouldn’t get upset at you for that and it’s not like you chose the location. She would need to chill if she got upset at you that you went to 6 flags with a group of kids without her. Just be honest next time.,"ESH

All ya'll need to grow up.  

It was a volunteer thing.  You didn't choose the destination.  It was a crazy happenstance that you went.  You should have said something to her.  It's not like you can't ever go there some other time, but you decided to keep it a secret for some reason.  

So she probably thinks that between not saying anything and then turning off locations, you lied about volunteering and she thinks you were cheating.  Crazy to take that much of a run with not being told where you were going, but since you were THAT secretive... Yeesh.",1,2
c55jsa,"We have a wedding in a few days and our photographer situation is in peril. At first we thought it was covered because a friend (#1) of a family member said they could do it. Well, 4 days ago they provided us with a proposed invoice of $2400. That was more than we were looking to spend, we have a tight budget to maintain.

Anyways, the family member managed to talk them down to $400 but that doesn't include any editing, just raw pictures. I feel like that is unacceptable and I don't want to be a choosing beggar and demand more for that price. Another friend of a family member is willing to give us a rate of $250 for full service. This individual (#2) has a really good portfolio and does some high quality work. The first photographer primarily does Instagram work and doesn't appear to have ever had a shoot for a wedding, though their pictures do look really nice.

Tomorrow I'm supposed to meet with photographer #2 and sign a contract to get the work done. There was nothing signed or official with photographer #1, just a verbal green light given 4 days ago when the price came down. Now that we have found photographer #2, I want to cancel photographer #1 but my fiancée says that is wrong. I feel bad but I feel like they are priced out of the market, even though I understand wedding pictures can get seriously expensive. I don't feel that we are choosing beggars because we aren't asking #1 to do more work for the same price, we simply shopped around and found somebody else.

I should add that #1 is going to be at the wedding no matter what because they are a friend of the family member, and may potentially help out with other things. I feel like this is going to get awkward if we cancel on them, not to mention potential damage to the relationship of the family member that knows them.

So Reddit, WIBTA for cancelling with photographer #1 and signing a contract with photographer #2?

EDIT: I do want to clarify that $400 is within our budget, $2400 is not. Also we did not haggle them down to $400, the family member did. I also want to be clear that we were trying to work with #1 at least a month in advance, we didn't hear anything back until 4 days ago. I'm not sure if it was a miscommunication or what, but that's why we're looking to cancel, dropping a last second invoice that's a bit out of our budget.","YTA. It’s a very short notice, honestly. I mean, if they weren’t a friend they would’ve probably taken a (non-refundable) deposit and your cancelling would’ve at least left them with that, but since that’s not the case, so yep, YTA.","Yta and you seem like a total CB. How did you get to a point where you're figuring this stuff out *two days* before the wedding? Are you eloping? Why didn't you figure this out months ago?

But dude... she’s a woman, it was a trick question. 

If she wears something ugly and asks “how do I look”? Do you say “ugly” or “gorgeous”?

If she asks “do you think I’ve put on weight” even if you do, would your answer ever be “yes”? 

She wasn’t asking for permission, she was asking  for your condonation... and as you know, sometimes with a gf there’s a *right* and *wrong* opinion...

cjse6a,"I’m turning 25. My bf is 24. We’ve been dating 10 months.

My 5 girlfriends are all 24 or 25 and we’ve all known each other since we were 8. 

I’ll start off by saying I’m not a big birthday person. I usually keep it very small, if I even do anything at all. 

It is my birthday in 2 weeks and I want to have a small dinner and some drinks with my girlfriends. Usually (for birthdays), it’s the 5 of us, plus the partner of whoever is having their birthday. 

My boyfriend has met my friends a few times and while he seems to get along with them when we’re out, he usually complains after that he finds them loud and annoying.

I don’t disagree. I can see how/why he’d feel like that, but I love them. I don’t ask that he always hangs out with us. I like my girl time/space from him.

In March (for a birthday again) my friends and I are planning a trip away. Only a weekend camping in the next state over so nothing big. Whenever I bring it up, my bf goes on and on about how it’s a ‘redneck place to go’ in the 'middle of nowhere' ect ect. 

The constant put downs about our camping trip and his comments about my friends has made me rethink my birthday dinner. I don’t want his comments, even after the event, ruining the day or bringing it down and I feel stressed by the idea of it. I think I would rather just go have dinner with my friends alone. 

WIBTA if I exclude him from the dinner and just go do something else with him, or invite him to dinner with my mom and brother later that week? I feel like he’s gonna throw a fit either way.",NTA but you really need to talk about stuff like this in a relationship. You should let him know how his negativity is affecting you.,"NTA.

erts5y,"Hey, I'm Ted, and I'm 14, and my parents divorced when I was 3.

So back in october my mother got super fucking drunk ( like say you have to kill the dog to ""put him out of his suffering, because he has allergies) and went to rehab for the 2nd time.

So while she has been in rehab I've been living with my grandmother ( I cant live with my dad right now because he lives in Maryland, and I live in georgia.)

So I went up there for christmas break, and finally had the courage to decide ""i wanna move here ASAP""

So that's exactly what i told my dad, and he is working on getting me up there now, so here is where i may be TA, I told my friends I'm moving there, but I'm too afraid to tell my family.  

So I told my dad ""I would prefer you to do it, I'm too nervous and scared to say it"" my dad is gonna tell my mom and grandma soon.

I just wanted to know if I'M TA here, my mother is a nightmare and I just wanna live with my dad and stepmom. (if you guys wanna know some of what my mom did I'll tell you in the comments if you ask)

Some of you guys have been asking different things, and I'll just wander them real quick
1. I am close to my grandparents
2. I have three siblings, but the one that I'm close to is living at my dads too
3. It'll be me, my dad, my brother, and my stepmom at my dads house
4. The reason I'm moving there are that I'm NOT happy most of the time
 
Some of the thing my mom has done are
...Got so drunk she tried to kill my sisters date
...Cries 3/7 nights
...Flips me off and curses at me when drunk
...Owes me about $125 ( which is a lot for me, cause I get $10 a week, so that's 3 MONTHS of work)
...Promises to take me somewhere then ""gets sick"" or ""forgets"" even though I'll tell her 5 or 6 times
...used to hit my sister
...is fine with my 15y/o brother smoking weed and drinking alchohol
... punishes me when she punishes 15y/o brother
... and has done sexual things with her boyfriends (that last 3 months or so, she threw out the only good one she had) while me and 15y/o bro were STILL AWAKE

ci2e9b,"My boyfriend and I (I'm female if that matters) have been together 1 year. We live 40 minutes apart. When we spend nights together (up until last week, 5-6 nights a week) we spend them at his place because he has dogs and it's a closer commute to work for both of us. His commute is 5 minutes, mine is 10. 

Three weeks ago I switched jobs and now we both start work at 7 am (I can really walk in around 7:15 though). It used to be 8:30. I'm quick getting ready so I can be out the door in 20-30 minutes. This means I'd ideally wake up and shower at 6. My boyfriend though, wakes up at 5:40 and doesn't get out of the bathroom until 6:20. Every single day. That's fine. Not even an issue, still time for me to shower and get to work.

Except. For whatever reason. And I will never be able to understand this. 

He doesn't shower until 6. Ever. Never ever. 

But he turns the freaking water on at 5:40 when he goes in the bathroom and let's it freaking run until 6 am. He uses the time to trim his beard (every freaking day), go pee, wake up, check his phone, whatever. 

Which not only is a tremendous waste of money and a fucking strain on the environment, but it means that my showers are ICE COLD. I've complained a billion times. He says that it's his routine and he's been doing it since way before he met me. 

He basically said that if I don't like it, wake up and take a shower before him. Which would mean waking up a full hour earlier than necessary considering there is plenty of time to get ready after him. 

I complained about it for two weeks, then woke up one week ago today and checked for hot water and it made me so mad that he'd done it again that I told him that I'll no longer be spending the weekdays with him because I'm not going to continue to inconvenience myself and start every morning off of a bad note with an ice cold shower over something that could easily be fixed. 

I offered to spend Friday and Saturday evenings with him, but have made it clear I'm going home every Sunday afternoon. For a week I've stuck to this. 

He texted me this morning telling me that he's looking forward to seeing me today but that he thinks I'm being very overdramatic about the situation and need to get over it before I ruin our relationship over something ""so stupid"". So he thinks it's my fault. 

I plan to spend tonight and tomorrow with him and go home on Sunday just like I did this week.

dpvjj4,"I have two daughters, aged 12 and 10, and I homeschool both of them. This school year, I decided to implement a ""dress code"" for school time. Towards the end of last school year, things got kind of tough. They'd frequently want to do school in their pajamas, and I didn't see a problem with it until they stopped doing their school work, got distracted, went back to sleep in the middle of schoolwork. We ended up getting behind by the end of the school year and had to supplement by doing school over the weekends and into the summer, which the girls weren't pleased about. 

&amp;#x200B;

This year, I decided to implement a ""dress code"" for homeschool. They are no longer allowed to do school in their pajamas. To really drive home the point, I bought some school skirts and tops for them to wear while doing school. I don't make them wear these every day, just on days when we have a lot of work to be done. I have found them to be a lot more focused and productive. My 10 year old loves her school outfit, my 12 year old not so much, but as we're at home most of the day, she doesn't mind too much.

I would say you should give your girls the option of wearing the skirts or pants. As long as they are dressed, focussed and working I don't think you need to enforce a specific outfit.",NTA  You are dividing home time from school time buy making them get dressed just like if they went to a public or private school.

bhcr8q,"So, I have some genetic problems that affect my bone marrow, blood, etc. It's not super serious currently, I just have to get labs done regularly to monitor the situation. Anyway, when I first was made aware of this condition, I was 15 and the doctor told me that I would most likely never have children without the aid of some drug which I looked up at the time and it's usually prescribed to cancer patients. Really gnarly side-effects. I just accepted that motherhood wasn't for me 11 years ago. 

This was further proved to me when I suffered a miscarriage by my ex fiance very early on. I was shocked by the pregnancy honestly. I had never been on BC because it could exacerbate my blood condition. I always assumed I was infertile, but it turns out my body is just not healthy enough to support a pregnancy to term. I didn't know how to feel about this.

Anyway, I have been dating my boyfriend for about a year and a half. Very early on in our relationship, we discussed children and I told him in no uncertain terms that I was NOT the one and I explained my health issues to him as best I could from my understanding of them.

Fast forward to recently and he tells me that he's been doing all of this research on myeloproliferative disorders and how motherhood can be possible for me, that there are new treatments available etc. He was VERY excited about it. I didn't know what to say. I guess I just accepted that I couldn't have children and that became my reality that I was okay with. 

He's been trying so hard to sell me on the idea and I finally just told him that I didn't even want kids. It got very ugly. He is upset with me because he feels I mislead him. I don't think that's fair. I told him in the beginning I was physically unable to have children, so in my mind him pursuing a relationship with me knowing that is on him. From his perspective, when I said that, he heard ""I would like children, but because of my health problems it isn't possible right now"". He thought I would be down to be a lab rat to have a child and I'm sorry, but I'm just not.

EDIT: I broke up with my boyfriend. I feel absolutely awful that I have unintentionally led him on about children.

an9r1y,"3 months ago I was going to a sleepover with my friend when my mom told me to call her when I got there. I forget though so she called my friend's mom who told her I was there. I assumed that I wouldn't have to call after that and then I got a text from her saying I better call her.

aq8qml,"Background: I have been dating this woman for one and a half years as of now, let's call her ""Lucy"". We have a lot in common, care for one another, and helped each other get through a couple of rough patches in our lives. 

Last week, her dad died at the age of 74 of a heart attack. To be blunt, me and him have a shitty relationship. Since Lucy introduced me to her family, her dad has taken a lot of time to insult me personally and put me down. I tell him my profession, (factory worker) and he says ""Yeah, you don't look like the kind of person who uses his head much"", never mind that I casually mention that I had a 3.5 GPA and got a bachelor's degree in criminal justice earlier. He also likes to criticize my looks, saying that ""I look like shit"" and once when I went to his house to return some containers we used for a party he says ""I thought I smelled something fowl enter my home."" He does this when Lucy is not around (bathroom, helping in kitchen, etc), but he'll be more subtle with his insults when she is around.

Lucy tells me the news and I put up a fake smile because I care for her and she lost her dad. I ask when is the funeral and she doesn't say. I asked her last Wednesday and no date has been confirmed. During such a time I agreed to dog-sit for a family friend who would be out of country the day after Valentine's Day. I tell Lucy this and she says ""oh that's when my dad's funeral is at x time, can you make it to the reception?"" I tell her I can't because I need to take care of the dogs and because I don't want to go. She asks if I don't like going to funerals, I tell her that I'm ok at funerals, I just don't want to go too her dad's funeral.

At this point, Lucy is getting upset and starts yelling at me that I never liked her dad and that I should go because she needs support. At first, I keep calm because she's getting emotional, but after a while I snap at her. I tell her what her dad says to me when she's not around, that I never liked him as a person, and that if it wasn't for me loving her, I would have nothing to do with him. I then tell her that I don't want to sit in a room feeling sorry for a man that I don't respect or have any sympathy for. Lucy snaps and calls me an ""asshole"" and that she'll have to rethink our relationship after the funeral is over.

This fight happened on Sunday and so far I've not received any text from Lucy since then. I'm afraid to text her because the only thing she would want to hear is an apology or an agreement to go too the funeral. I don't want our relationship to end because I do care for her. So am I the asshole for not going to the funeral of her dad?

Edit: The conclusion is that I am an asshole. I accept the judgement on Reddit. I'll talk to Lucy later tonight, apologize, and tell her that I'll go the funeral if she still wants me too. Will do it in person as well since I should take responsibility for my actions and words. Thank you for the help.

Update: As of 5:50pm EST. I contacted Lucy asking if we can talk. She agreed, but only for a little as she had plans after dinner. Went over to her place (we dont live together as of yet) and had a frank conversation. She isn't happy with me not just because I said those things about her dad, but also because I didn't tell her about his comments when they first occurred. That told her that I'm keeping some things to myself, which she hates. I asked if she wants me to still go to the funeral, she said she's not sure. We both agreed to cancel Valentine's Day plans together since she needs time to think things over about us and her dad's funeral is giving her a lot of emotional stress. I apologized for my actions, she appreciated that I apologized and did it person rather then via text. We hugged, said goodbyes, and I left. I fucked up big time.","If not SHP - YTA. You weren't invited to the funeral to grieve for your girlfriend's father. You were invited to emotionally support your girlfriend.

Empathy. You should try it some time.","YTA - Her dad was old as fuck. Old people say crazy things. When a death like this happens you support your partner because they hurt. It's not about you.

ej369i,"For background, I work at a company that strongly 'encourages' admin employees to comp their time instead of getting paid overtime.  I also have a four hour a day commute.  (This is a given as I accepted the job with the commute, I am just adding this in to help show the amount of time each day I am taking out for work, which adds to my frustration)

This past week I have been required to work a significant amount of overtime.  My given schedule is 40 hours a week, Mon-Fri.  Since it was the holiday, I was supposed to be given holiday pay for 4 hours Tuesday and 8 hours on Wednesday and be able to stay home. 

Instead, these were the hours I physically was working.

Mon- 8hrs
Tues- 18 hrs (no holiday hours included)
Wed- 10.75 hrs  (no holiday hours included)
Thurs- 10.25 hrs (anticipating for today)
Fri- 4 hrs (supervisor is sending me home to comp 4 hours)
Sat- 0 
Sun- 6hrs (anticipated due to current schedule)

Last week I had some overtime (only 4.5) and took a sick day.  My supervisor is wanting me to, instead of using sick time, comp 8 hours of my overtime and comp the 4 hours tomorrow.

WIBTA to push for getting paid out the hours?  I already agreed to comp 4 of them, so I won't go back on that.  However, I feel like I should be getting paid for the rest of them and use sick time instead of comping the other 8.  

I also feel as though I should get some of the holiday hours for at least the Wednesday as I was supposed to have 8 hours PTO for New Years.  

I do not want to sound entitled or unprofessional, however I feel that I should be financially compensated for my time. So WIBTA?

Edit: For clarification, they're asking me to essentially take free vacation days in order to not have overtime.  If I work M- 16, T-16, W-8, then Th-0, F,-0.  When I enter my time its 40 and I have no overtime.  Not sure if this effects the answers about the legality of the company's practices.",By comp you mean work unpaid?

I hadn’t heard from either sibling in almost 6 years. I learned my brother had moved to a new country in passing in an email from my sister. 

Yesterday he called and said he’s gone bankrupt and he needs $65,000 to avoid bankruptcy plus another $23,000 to keep his kids in college. I told him no. My sister is calling now telling me I have to support him because we are family. 

I’m doing fine but not so fine that I have tens of thousands of dollars easily accessible. He hasn’t spoken to me in ten years, did not fly in for my wedding, and did not respond to the email I sent to the family letting them know we were expecting. 

I can see the reverse of this though that it’s not his kids fault that my relationship with him is strained and maybe I should at least help with their college. It wouldn’t be an easy thing. We’d have to cancel an upcoming vacation, put off getting a second car (our current car is pretty small for a baby) and I wouldn’t be able to take as much time off after the baby is born. 

He is family, bankruptcy is serious, and this would probably be a major bridge burner if I stand firm on it. But also, there’s a long list of people I’d more readily lend money to. 

So, am I the asshole? ","NTA

3gmb5p,"A couple days ago I went over to my mate's house for a little kickback. A few other people were there, including an Ex of his. They were on good terms, or so I thought (Why would she be invited if she wasn't?). Anyway we all have a bit too much to drink and next thing I know I'm making out with this girl. Me and this girl were never super close, but we definitely had history. Mostly through the mutual friend hosting the party. Things got out of hand, one thing led to another, you get the picture. After the party she leaves the next day for some family vacation. 

Now, he wouldn't outright say he was mad. Initially when I told him he said it was ""fucking hilarious"" and that he actually wasn't mad. I believed him and agreed to chill with them the next day. I hang out with my friend and his new girlfriend, and they're both giving me a lot of shit for having sex with his Ex. Making jokes in really bad taste, asking really prodding details (He knows I don't like bragging about any sort of escapades). Not your typical ""How'd it go"" shit, but like really personal questions. Like to the point where they're actually making uncomfortable and having me look for an excuse to leave. 

 I don't regret what I did, but I felt like I could've gotten the OK from him before all this happened. In that regard, I may be the asshole. But the way he acted towards me was inexcusable. Seriously unlike I've ever seen him in our six years of being best friends. It was backhanded, mean, and so unlike the guy I know.

cy1g8y,"So a bit of back story, I (33F) live alone in a 4 story walk up &amp; have a few creepy neighbors (I know, how's it possible with a building so small? You'd be amazed...anyways). Our building is one of those buildings with front door, a mail room lobby &amp; then second door to get into the actual building (only outsides require keys).

This one neighbor(65-80M) in particular has ALWAYS made me uncomfortable. He has a habit of trying to force people into long conversations with him (he explained one time that he does this for entertainment). He's generally annoying outside of this as well but this is my main issue. 

I've learned how to exit a conversation abruptly fairly well due to this, so I thank him for that, except the other day. I was coming back home when I see said neighbor doing god knows what to the front lawn adjacent the front door entrance. My headphones in, trying to pretend like I can't hear, to avoid getting into one of his endless convos . Sadly, he springs into action getting to the front door before me opening it letting me in behind him. Before I have the chance to get through the second door &amp; make my escape he physically blocks it. I mean literally physically places his forearm on the door with his body in the way. Imagine one of those cliche poses of a guy leaning against a wall trying to look cool while hitting on someone type of pose. 

I look at him with a look that clearly displays both my annoyance and dismay at the realization at what he's doing. My facial expression now showing sheer aggravation he starts with his usual ""Ya know what?...."" expecting the answer of, ""no....what?""... 

Except this time, I couldn't take it. Something fucking broke guys. Like no joke. I guess the build up of having to see him walking shirtless around the building, having to listen to him bitch &amp; complain, &amp; gossip about other neighbors &amp; our landlord, or him trying to start endless conversation with me, once with his shirt off &amp; button of his jeans undone, &amp; endless other utter fucking nonsense from him, just broke me. I told him, ""I don't fucking care. Now get out of my fucking way"" pulled the door open with force getting him to move. A look of complete &amp; utter shock lay across his face. I didn't care.

Now that the anger has subsided, I see there was another less abrasive method of handling this situation - I could have (&amp; will next time he pulls this stunt) simply used the front front door to exit the building &amp; walk around to the back entrance. Or I could have simply kept my cool also, but alas, here we are. 

Now I know he's TA most of the time, but was ITA in this situation? 

TLDR: I flipped out on an elderly neighbor of mine for not letting me into my own building. AITA?","NTA , this is harassment .

I turned to see her smiling, so I asked her if she thought she of all people had the right to call people fat. I don’t think she understood what I meant at first, so I said to her that she’s half my height and probably twice my weight. Between the two of us, she’s the heffer.

The houses we were going to were pretty close. Anyways after a while I text her to see if she got home ok, and she asked me if I wanted to come over ""For like an hour or half an hour"". I said yes and went to meet her. 

When I got there, she said she had to go to her house real quick to get something. We get in and go up to her bedroom, just me and her.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, my ex-boyfriend and I are still in regular contact as we are the only people we really know ***well*** in this city. We are still best friends (probably not after this, though!). I am moving into another apartment by the end of this month (July), and he knows this.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have that much stuff, just a few boxes and some heavy furniture. Basically, I can't move it by myself, but it can easily be moved with two people and a U-Haul. I will be paying for the U-Haul. When I was organizing my move a few months ago, I asked him if he would be willing to help me move. He enthusiastically agreed to it (""Of course!""), and that was that. We've spoken about this for a while; I've even talked to him about specifics. Everyone in my life knows that he was supposed to help me move. I really cannot emphasize enough how concrete these plans are.

&amp;#x200B;

So, he went on vacation for the first two weeks of July, which was fine and planned. Except he ended up extending his vacation... until some time in August.

&amp;#x200B;

He will now no longer be here when I have to move, and I don't have time to get relatives or friends from out of the city to help me, as everyone is already busy and this is on very short notice. (I am moving next week.) My new roommate is also out of town, which the ex in question knows. That's part of why I asked him in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

I am busy doing a lot of things at the moment, including finishing packing up my stuff AND finishing my thesis, so it's hard to call around to everyone I know to see if they can fly into this city to help me move. The easiest thing to do is hire movers, but he will not talk about that or help me with the cost. I don't have that much money right now as I am just finishing grad school. He knows this; that is why he agreed to help me in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

He says it is unreasonable for me to expect that he would help me and follow through on that, that he is a single man and can enjoy his vacation how he likes. He says he has no obligation or responsibility to me because we are not in a relationship anymore. The thing is that... this is true? I know this. **But** he made these promises after we broke up, and we are still good friends!!!

&amp;#x200B;

This situation has gotten so out of hand that a bunch of people are now involved, and I now am starting to think that I am the asshole for expecting him to help me move when he said he would do so. Is it wrong to at least think he should pay for the movers? I feel like I am going crazy. So, reddit, please tell me. AITA?

cfr84x,"I am a minor taking college classes in Ohio. In one of my classes, a professor, who also teaches on campus, is also taking the course. She's really nice and friendly. However, recently, before class formally begins, she vapes inside the classroom. I, myself, have chosen not to vape and, since we are in a small classroom, also have to be breathing in what she smokes. Another student complained to her but she insisted that it's harmless. She claims that it's only the tobacco companies trying to send out the message that vaping is just as bad as smoking.

The college has signs that say that smoking is illegal but I don't know if that also applies with vaping.

aqsdd8,"TL;DR my brother believes there should be a religiously enforced quiet time between the hours of 8pm and 6am, including no talking anywhere in the house. I don't agree.

So my brother and I (23 and 25 respectively) live with our parents - I'm disabled and can't afford rent if I moved out, but help out around the house to compensate, and we have a roommate - a friend of mine - who pays rent and helps out around the house (pet sits, takes care of dishes, cleans up kitchen). 

My brother, who doesn't pay rent, and who begrudgingly takes out the trash once a week if you remind him to, works fulltime as a banker, and he goes into work around 7am, waking up around 6am. Ever since he got this job, he's decided he needs to be in bed by 8pm every night, sunday through friday, with the sole exception being saturday, when he'll stay up until 2am playing games with friends online. 

I wouldn't have any issues with this, except he expects everyone in the household to be quiet after 8pm so he can fall asleep without being disturbed. I'll be out in the living room watching tv, maybe talking to my roommate, and get a text from him asking me to keep it down because he's trying to sleep. So I'll turn the volume down on the tv (until I can barely understand what people are saying) and if I'm chatting with my roommate, we'll turn to not-quite-whispering levels of quiet conversation. This isn't enough for my brother. If he is trying to sleep, any media not restricted to headphones, or any conversation, is apparently far too much, and if you talk after his designated bedtime, he sends constant text messages nagging you to be quiet.

Tonight, I'm celebrating Valentine's Day with my roommate - basically just hanging out, drinking a bit of wine, eating cheese and berries and chocolate, having a nice relaxed time in lieu of any partners or romantic plans. At 9, I got the standard message; ""can you keep it down? I'm trying to sleep!"" So I reply affirmatively, and my roommate and I turn down the volume, but continue to talk and hang out, not ready to wind down for the night. Next thing I know, my mom calls me to let me know she just got off the phone with my brother, who was complaining that we were making too much noise. I had to go to her room and explain we were being quiet, but didn't intend to go to bed just yet as it was not yet 10pm on Valentine's Day and we had a right to enjoy the holiday outside of his self-designated socializing hours. My Mom agreed but advised we just ""try to be quieter"" in the spirit of keeping the peace.

I guess most of my anger is that if he were paying rent, or helping out around the house at all, contributing in any way, and I had agreed to be quiet past 8pm, I would find it reasonable, if extreme, that I'm not allowed to talk to anyone past 8, but as it is, he works because mom gave him an ultimatum a few years ago that he needed to find a job (with the understanding he'd help with rent or bills) or help out more around the house, and he chose to work, but he goes to work, earns a paycheck, contributes none to the household, and uses the job as both an excuse to not do housework and a reasoning for why he's better than me (again, I'm disabled, wheelchair bound when not bedridden, and still do what I can to care for the pets and clean the house to earn my keep). Sorry, this is turning into more of a rant than I intended.

So basically, I don't see a reason I should put my life on hold at 8pm almost every night, when he contributes nothing to the house, and especially when he's not tried exploring other ways to fall asleep that doesn't rely on my silence, like a white noise machine, or listening to music to fall asleep.

To start off, they met their fiancé  not very long ago and has torn my relationship to shreds (going on 5 years). They did this by saying that I don’t really have a serious relationship because I don’t have a ring on my finger and that it’s nothing special. Now this genuinely hurt my feelings and I don’t want to subject myself to hearing this from them all day at the wedding. This continued when my SO was almost not invited because “we may break up before”.... which I have no idea where that came from since the wedding was 2 months from the engagement. 

Apart from just feeling bad about myself from their insults, they are really good friends with an abusive ex of mine who I’m sure will be there with their whole family. They have told people that my ex wasn’t that bad and that I’m just dramatic so I don’t want to be “that person” that doesn’t go because their ex is there. 

I’ve had everybody (but my parents) tell me not to go, and my parents are saying I have to since we were friends for so long.

So she showed up at my house randomly to invite them lol.

I generally like dogs, but I do know a number of people that are allergic to dogs, afraid of dogs, etc.  My feeling is that people taking dogs where they shouldn't are abusing the general non-confrontational behavior of people, staff, etc, while stepping on rules.  

I see a couple in line at a food court restaurant in the mall. It's something the size of a German Shepherd, and on a leash. I say to the guy holding the leash, ""Dogs aren't allowed in the food court.""

He looks at me and just nods. 

So I say, ""That is a dog. This is a food court. Your dog is in it.""

He just nods, smiles, gives a ""yep."". The woman he was with says to me, ""You need to step back.""

So, I leave. 

My issue -- the mall is apparently dog friendly. Indoor food establishments in California don't allow dogs, but there doesn't appear to be a sign. 

So, am I the asshole?


Edit:

So, good news!

Thanks to everyone saying I shouldn't try to enforce the law, and instead find someone in authority, I found out that I could get a reward of up to $100 for reporting just this one incident.  And if they find it's a common occurrence, I could end up with $5k!

If that happens, r/RandomActsOfPiizza will have a very good day.


Edit:

For the record, I did get a note back from the department of health:

""I am at the mall conducting inspections at least once a week and have noticed the same issue. The only dogs allowed in the food court and dining area/terrace are service animals. Per ADA service animal law, no identification or vest is required to indicate proof of a service animal. The only legal questions may be asked:

Is that dog a service animal?
If so, what services does the animal provide?
Emotional support is not considered an approved service for service animals. I have included some handouts on service animals. Unfortunately, when I ask the above questions, majority of the time the public states the dog is a service animal and gets very upset when I try to ask the second question. I simply provide the information to those I see with dogs and let them know only service animals are allowed and no pets. There are signs posted throughout the facility, however I have told mall management to provide bigger signs or have security monitor the food court more. Anytime I see an animal and it has been confirmed that the dog is not a service animal, I report it to mall management to have security handle the manner. If you would like to put in a formal complaint, I will be happy to take care of the complaint and sit down with mall management.

&gt;So I say, ""That is a dog. This is a food court. Your dog is in it.""

That's really condescending considering the fact that you don't even work in that mall. Plus, if the mall is explicitly ""dog friendly"" then is this even a problem? If no one in the mall (workers, security guards, etc.) has said anything about these dogs then I'd assume they're allowed there.","YTA,
If the mall is pet friendly then they are allowed to be there. As a service dog handler I avoid pet friendly places since pets can be wild.

Ok so later I start to learn some weird things. The camp is for 12-16 year olds so I have to lie about my age. I was very against this at first again but my mom reassured me there are plenty of other girls lying about their age too and there are a couple girls my same age. Ok mom... Then me and my mom have to go shopping for clothes because I have to be covered. I was told I needed shirts that cover your butt at least. So my mom and I wasted about \~$100 on clothes that are not even my size. My tattoos also have to be covered at all times and I am going to have hide that as well. It's July btw and I hate wearing long-sleeves/pants in the summer. BUT... I push on for my mom. It will make my parents SO SO happy.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have pet rats, I asked my mom if she could come pick me up from the camp at least once a week so I could just come back and clean them up because she is scared of them. She agreed to this as well. At this point I'm pretty ok with the idea of bearing through 2 weeks. The camp ends July 26 and I start my Java certification Aug 5, so this will be a really good time to practice my coding.

&amp;#x200B;

The day before we are to go to the camp, they send us an email of a checklist of things we need. Yes, a day before. The entire thing is in Turkish. God knows why. I google translate the whole thing. They specifically state there are no electronics allowed, they will take our phones and only allow 1 hour of usage in the evening. They also make it very clear that no one may leave the camp to visit family or for any non-emergency reason. I'm super mad. I feel like this is going to be a horrible experience now. I don't even care about the religion, I was just going for my parents and maybe teach them a thing or two I pick up. I feel super fucked over. I'm debating just showing them my ID and tattoos and saying I need to go home. I'm sure they will kick me out. I will HAPPILY pay my mom back the $400 (bc im sure they won't refund us).  My parents will be furious though.

a2ok35,"Yesterday, I got on a plane for a 6 hour flight across the US. Traveling is usually not too bad for me, because I'm like 5'0, 90lbs, despite being a 15 year old boy, so leg room is never an issue.

My flight was under booked, so there was only gonna be one other person in my row of three. I settle into the window seat (which was on my ticket) and wait. Finally, a woman shows up, she's about 25 and very tall, like maybe 5'11 or 6'0. She sits down in the aisle seat leaving a gap between us cause why not.

She makes friendly conversation with me, talking about her work and stuff, and I politely smile and listen, I don't mind any of that. Then she asks, because she's so tall, if she can have the window seat so she can stretch her legs without blocking the aisle. I happily say yes and switch with her and there's no problem. 

A bit into the flight, she starts putting her stuff on the middle seat; her bag, her laptop - just for extra storage. I truly don't mind, I wouldn't have used it anyway. But then, she tells me that she's feeling really cramped, and needs more leg room. My legs barely touch the floor, so I offered to sit criss cross so she could stretch her legs across all three seats. 

Things are fine for a while, I figure this won't be for the whole flight, but I notice her getting comfortable when she takers her shoes off. Twenty minutes later she fell asleep, still completely spread out, with her headphones in.

I'm the absolute worst at confrontation, and I couldn't bring myself to say anything to her. When the drink cart came around, I got a ginger ale, but didn't wake her up for anything. I then decided that I had enough of her sitting like this, so I ""accidentally"" spilled some soda onto her legs. She woke up, and I apologized saying it was an accident. She smiled and said it was all okay and moved her legs. I had my leg room for the rest of the flight.

I honestly feel really bad about doing it, part of me feels like she was being respectful the whole time and that I was the one out of place, but part of me also feels like she shouldn't have done that. Was I an asshole?

cnnsar,"I live in a city with pretty limited parking. All parking on the street is public, except for marked spaces reserved for people with disabilities. Those are right in front of the person's house so they can get in and out easily.

A few people in the area will put garbage, chairs, cones, all sorts of shit in the street to mark spots as their own, which is a pain in the ass because public parking is available on the assumption that not everyone is gonna be parked at once. There's just not enough space for everyone to have their dedicated spot.

Lots of people will toss these chairs and cones to the curb or into the street anyway, which makes a mess, and gets in the way of driving or walking.

On another note, my boyfriend and I are hosting a housewarming party for our new place. We've got a big back yard and want to do a barbecue.

We needed a lot of chairs and we were about to buy a whole bunch of those stackable white plastic lawn chairs even though that would have cost a bit...

Then I had the idea of just driving about and picking up chairs left in the streets. I took my truck out and filled the bed with ""parking chairs"". 

The party was great, and I told a few of my friends about our chair gathering scheme, and most of them thought it was funny, but one of my friends thought it was super shitty of me, and it was borderline stealing. 

I thought that shit left in the street or curb is basically left as trash, and that I was not stealing.

My friend said it kind of was; people had left their chairs out expecting them to still be there; it's just one of those social norms that people follow.

axmwmk,"I am from Lithuania however my grandfather is of mixed Lithuanian and Latvian heritage and has lived in Latvia most of his life. During WW2 he joined the Latvian Legion, 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS. He fought bravely against the red devils to protect the baltic region from communism and Soviet occupation. He is hero. I know what you're thinking, he fought for the nazis and they're evil. I'm not denying Nazi war crimes, they did awful things however you need to realize the complicated situation we were in. The Soviets invaded and conquered Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and fighting with the Nazis was the only way to regain our independence. The Soviets committed horrible atrocities against us and were by far the greater evil. Growing up he told me stories of fighting the commies and killing those bastards. Look i know atrocities occur in war on both sides and the Latvian SS did do some horrific things including taking part in Genocide. My grandfather even knew Herberts Cukurs, who is notorious for his crimes. My grandfather and his buddies were not involved in any of that. They only killed russians. Now in University we had a discussion about WW2 and I got my Grandfather to come over to speak. He comes he relives his childhood growing up in Latvia, soviet Union and fighting the Soviets. People were so rude to him. They would ask him questions such as ""why the fuck would you join the nazis"" ""oh how many jews are you responsible for killing"" ""i hope you burn in hell for your crimes."" One Israeli exchange student stands up and calls my grandfather a Latvian hitler and goes on about how he and the israeli people will never forgive my grandfather for what he did. I just about had it at this point and I scream at his face to shut the fuck up and tell him I'd knock him out if he or anyone else ever disrespected my grandfather again.I then remind everyone of the horrors of Soviet occupation of my country (nobody in the class is from the baltic region so they are unfamiliar) and explain how living under the soviets was hell. We starved and lacked basic human rights for the 50 years. Anyone who fought to prevent that was a hero in my eyes.  The Israeli  then proceeds to call my grandfather a nazi again and say that he belongs in prison for working with the nazi and that they should've joined the soviets. I just about lose it and with all my might gave him a right hook deeply cutting his lip. He didn't get up from the floor but the class was in awe. I am now under investigation from the school administration and facing expulsion.

daw882,"So a few days ago I had a sibling meetup out of town. Myself and my brother live in city A, and were meeting our sister from city B in a touristy area between both our cities. It’s about a 45 minute drive each way for myself to reach said town plus another like 20$ to park downtown. I decided to offer to drive with the expectation that we’d split gas and parking (yes we both agreed). So my brother drove to my place, parked his car and I drove us to where our sister was. We had a fun day and returned later that evening. There was a game on that night that both my brother and I wanted to watch, and we had previously planned to go to the sports bar a couple minutes away from my apartment to do so. So we’re getting ready to leave and I ask if he can drive me. I figure it’s a 3 minute return trip at either half time or after the game and since I know I’m going to be drinking, I was hoping to not have to pay ~10$ for an Uber. He has to drive home so I know he’s not going to be drinking and I figure at most it’s 5 minutes out of his way after I had just spent an hour and a half ferrying him across the state. Important to note at this point I had not been paid for gas or parking but I had also not brought it up. He says no he doesn’t want to, he wants to go straight home and that I can call an Uber. I reply with an “oh... okay.” I let the marinate for a minute and then say something to the tune of “you know it’s funny, I think my friend’s siblings would go more out of their way for me than my own siblings.” He gets up and leaves and says I’m not dealing with this. I end up cancelling and just watch from my home.

cikm7h,"Summer's very busy with birthdays.  My own birthday is first, then my (step) daughter, then my son and the niece in question, then my other niece, and my (foster) daughter's is last.   All birthdays span late June- early August.

I planned to do something for my b-day (Friday). My husband and I still make big deals of each other's b-day, so we planned my party for that Saturday.   Nothing too fancy- just cake and presents with my hubby and the kids, getting a babysitter, and going out to eat at a fancy restaurant.  We set the reservations and talked to my mom about babysitting the kids. 

A few days before, I get an invitation in the mail from my SIL and brother for my niece's b-day party.  It is set the same day I was going to do something for mine.   My mom calls to cancel babysitting.  It was easy enough to get someone else to babysit, but I am torn at this point and consider canceling my own b-day.   I told my mom that I was kind of disappointed because my niece's birthday was still far enough out that if the party had been scheduled in upcoming weeks, it would have been closer to her actual birthday.  My mom actually said ""yeah, it's crazy they are planning so early, but I don't think they knew it was your birthday.""    

My mom follows up with my SIL and asks if she knew the party was scheduled the day after my birthday.  My SIL apparently said that she knew, but figured she gave me enough advanced notice that I wouldn't plan anything.   TBH, that kind of pissed me off.  Until this point I had genuinely considered canceling my plans and rescheduling,  but this was under the assumption that they didn't know about my b-day.   In my head, it was more forgivable to forget my birthday than to intentionally plan something despite it being my b-day. My SIL did the latter.   
I reached out to my SIL to let her know that I wouldn't make it because I had b-day plans, but would get the presents to her at a later time.  We planned to have a get together at their house to celebrate all the kids' birthdays together. She reiterated that she thought I would just be able to plan my birthday around their party.  

Thing is, they blow off plans and ask people to change their plans constantly. Last Christmas, for example, I was going to have a family get together/meal starting at 3 pm.  My SIL told me that they would not come unless I had it earlier because my plans interfered with naptime (nieces don't nap anywhere but daycare, home, and her parents' house).  I changed the time to 10 am and had a Christmas brunch instead.

Anyhow, shortly after, another family member reached out and yelled at me for being so selfish.  I think they might have a point and feel pretty bad about not going now.  It wasn't my niece's fault their parents scheduled the party when they did so I kinda feel like I punished her- AITA?","TOTALLY NTA, i'm just baffled by reading this, how can someone intentionally plan something on your own b-day and expect you to cancel everything, especially when your niece's b-day is a few days later","Sorry but YTA - maybe not about the other “events” but really, you’re a grown up now.

cv7oj5,"I literally lost my whole friend group over this because it was “such an asshole move” but we still feel like we were justified. So here’s the details. 

We currently live in Italy and had planned a trip to London for 5 days. My friend Josie asked to borrow my car while we were gone to pick up a mutual friend 1.5 hours away and we agreed. 

Our 2nd day in London, Josie messages me and says “I’m pulled off on the side of the road, the car won’t start.” My response is “ Okay. Is it clicking when you try to start it? Have you given it a few minutes rest before trying to start it?” She tells me that it’s not clicking, and that she tried to give it a few minutes but it won’t start. She has called her husband and he’s on the way to her. She gets a $350 quote for a tow, and we agree to pay it and transfer her the money. We told her that it needed to be towed to a specific military base where our mechanic agreed to pick it up (we had some work done on the car two weeks prior to fix a belt issue and thought the new belt might need an adjustment). Instead, she tows it to a base that is 35mins away from where we requested it to be. She knew that it was the wrong base when she arrived, but she decided to sign the driver onto that base anyway(he can’t get onto base without her signature at the gate). She then let the tow truck park the car into a space clearly labeled“no overnight parking”even though she knew we wouldn’t be home for another 5 days. 

She apologized that she towed it to the wrong base, but said that she was justified in leaving it there because she didn’t want to argue with the driver and just wanted to go home because she was tired. We asked her to pay the $80 tow to get it from the wrong base to where we requested it to be (which we had to pay additional to the $350) and she got very angry and said that she did us a favor to tow it.

She then went and told her side to our mutual friends and I have lost three of my close friends over this. I was told that I was an asshole because I didn’t ask if she was okay on the side of the road and that we never should have been upset about it being towed to the wrong place because we gave her an “unreliable car”. Our car had worked fine for two weeks after the belt replacement and it turns out the alternator broke when she was driving, so it was an unrelated fluke. I also learned that she borrowed my car without having a driver's license, which is another reason she didn’t want to argue with the tow truck, but she didn’t tell me that she didn’t have a license when she borrowed the car!

So, am I the asshole here? I agree that I could have asked if she was okay, but I assumed she was fine because she was on the side of the road, her husband was on the way, and she was texting me.","NTA

You lent your friend your car and then it broke down when she was using it... Honestly at that point it was pretty up in the air who paid for the mechanic, but you went and did it without issue.

I told the grandpa “You cannot bring this dog in here.” The grandpa gave me a weird look and put the dog on my porch, shutting the door. I explained that the child has allergies and the grandpa said, “Not to my dog, it’s hypoallergenic.” Okay, yeah, maybe but not taking a risk. Then he says “That’s my service dog.” I’ve never seen this guy with a dog before. I asked him to please not bring the dog.

Last year he told me that he's bisexual, but asked me not to say anything to our parents yet because he wants to tell them when he's ready. I don't have an issue with any of that since it's his privacy.

My brother thinks their relationship is fine because they go (or used to go) to the same school. But whenever I ask him for more details, like if their relationship is still platonic or if they're messing around already, he likes to switch the topic or tell me I'm being nosey.

I love each and every one of them very much and I’m more than happy to spend it with them. 

At first, I thought we were doing just dinner with them. I mentioned to my grandparents both that I really wanted to try a specific bakery’s cake, and gave the flavor information to my grandma (my favorite is strawberry cake, but I do also love chocolate).

I feel badly about being upset about this but I feel like I’ve compromised a lot on what my last day would be while visiting, and it’s supposed to be for my birthday and they didn’t even ask if I liked cherry cake. 

I feel petty. But I’m upset. 

Am I the asshole?","I'd be more pissed off about the restaurant choice than the cake. Who takes a vegetarian to a steak restaurant for their birthday? NAH.

eii7kc,"I'll make this short and simple. I'm (f24) renting a house with a few other girls while in grad school. They were out of town for the holidays and the weather is still nice here, so I decided to take advantage and use this opportunity to tan naked in the backyard. I like being able to even out my tan lines in the comfort of my own home. 

My most recent tanning session was interrupted by a neighbor at my door. My neighborhood has lots of inclines and hills in it, so there is actually a house above our backyard that can see into it. This woman had caught her husband peeking at me while tanning and was irate that I would be nude outdoors. I calmly told her I was free to dress how I liked in the comfort of my home, and it is not my fault where her husband does or doesn't look. She proceeded to yell at me for being a tramp.

So, AITA for being naked in my backyard?","a) this is a shitpost

b) if you claimed to be a guy in this made up story reddit would be calling you a sex offender

c) the correct answer is YTA, but reddit will never say that because you're pretending to be female","

b0ymk0,"My friend and I were just on our way to breakfast, and I randomly asked her what animal rights were like in Korea. She then proceeded to tell me her grandad used to hunt to eat, survive. And I said, great, I completely get that. But what about nowadays? What do modern people think about hunting? And she got quite offended, like I was attacking her culture. She said that her friends and most people in Korea didn't really like talking about stuff like this and that it was a heavy subject. They usually talked about celebrities, and maybe they might talk about this kind of thing if it was trending on the news. She started to get really stressed out and started crying.

I get that maybe she didn't like talking about it, but for me, this kind of thing is important but has never been a heavy subject when I talked about it with others. It's like... a part of a person's values. But now I feel like I might have done something wrong? Or not? I literally can't figure it out.

d078jy,"A little background.
My family is very close.  We literally get together when someone farts. In the last 31 years I have missed two get togethers.  I am the youngest of four kids.  And by youngest I mean my siblings are 21+ years older than me. My parents are in their 80s.  
Every holiday my family brings up every crappy thing that I've done. My dad, who I do love very much, constantly talks about how if he could do it over he would never have a child in his 50s and how I pretty much ruined their retirement years. I mean I get it, I did.  My siblings constantly bicker about who is the favorite and how I don't even come close.  I know, and I don't care.  My sister, who has never liked me, likes to remind everyone of how much she does for my parents and how awesome she is.  She is one of those people who does nice things for people so she can brag about it.  One of my brothers is always high and never shuts up.  My other brother I actually get along with.  My mom lives in a perfect world and pretends everything is awesome.  
I am tired of feeling like I have to go to family events because my parents are older and it might be the last holiday I get with them.  I have a terrible time with regret. I know my parents will be upset if I don't go to Thanksgiving this year.  I leave almost every family event upset.  I couldn't tell you the last time I left Thanksgiving Dinner without immediately crying in the car.  
The last couple years I've wanted to just stay home in my jammies, watch the parade, and eat until we almost barf with my husband and kids.  I love my family and my parents are literally the best parents a kid could ask for.  Their positives far out weigh their negatives.

I’ve made her aware of the noise and disruption she’s making and that hasn’t stopped her. We haven’t dealt or heard a complaint from the downstairs neighbor yet. I’m ashamed of her actions and can’t help but think that if it was me dealing with somebody stomping around at the early hours of the morning I would be pissed.

b52tza,"I’ve been dating a guy for two months. Throughout this time I’ve felt like I’m on an emotional rollercoaster. Sometimes he’s in a great mood, is affectionate and nice but others he is very cold, distant, and moody. He often rants on text message about things that are annoying him or stressing him out and I’ve always listened and given him space to vent. It’s so confusing because on some dates he’s turned up with flowers and has been all over me then on others it’s like he treats me with contempt. 

Friday night we went out for dinner and as soon as I arrived at the restaurant I could tell he was in a bad mood. He grunted hello, was giving me one word answers and didn’t seem to want to speak to me. I complimented him on his outfit and told him he looked nice to which he said: “I was going to say the same to you but I can’t be bothered.” He very rarely pays me compliments and it hurt to hear him say this especially as id really made an effort to look good. 

Id been excited about going out with him and had been looking forward to dinner but his coldness completely threw me. I asked him if he was ok and he just replied that he was in a bad mood. I asked why and he said ‘I don’t know, I just am. I don’t need to have a reason, deal with it.’ I know he’s stressed with work at the moment but I felt so uncomfortable with how he was behaving that I said instead of sitting in silence and having an awkward dinner I’d rather go home. To clarify, this was the third time he had behaved like this towards me but the previous two times I hadn’t said anything. 

He blew up at me at this point and said I was over reacting and that it was his right to be in a bad mood if he wanted to. I said I’d leave him to it, got up and left.

Since then he’s messaged me saying I’m pathetic, a drama queen and that I am obviously used to men ‘kissing my ass’ which he is not prepared to do. AITA here guys for walking out like that? I’m feeling really bad right now. 

EDIT: wow I am shocked at how this has blown up! Thank you so much to every one of you who has taken the time to reply, the comments have been super helpful and they mean a lot. I guess I need to look at why I was even second guessing myself, I think my self esteem is quite low which is why I’ve been doubting how I behaved.

dryueg,"So this happened 5 years ago, I’m pretty sure I’m the asshole but when talking to my brother he suggested posting it on here just for some light hearted humour. 

(On mobile does sorry for any errors!) 

For my (f) 21st birthday, I went play mini golf with my older brother, older sister and my sisters boyfriend  in Manchester. 

Had a great time going round the course, there was two people behind us that appeared to be on a first date and a small family in front (a mum, dad and a 4 or 5 year old girl) 

So it was slow moving because the little girl took her time, we didn’t mind waiting as we were just having a good time. The girl from the couple behind us kept huffing loudly, under the breath complaints about how slow it was moving etc every time she had to wait. We let her go I front of us, and the family did as well so they didn’t have to wait.

Well as she walked past I let out a silent fart, not realising it would be rank. The girl walked straight through it and spread the smell, everyone could smell it - my brother swears he could taste it. It was toxic. 

Now the part where I may have been a dick, the little girl goes “ewwww ” then points to the woman who just walked past from the couple and goes “mummy I think she filled her nappy” and the guy from the couple stepped back to look down at her arse. 

That was it, we were laughing, the family was laughing, I was crying. The girl was trying defend herself saying it wasn’t her, her boyfriend was saying “everyone does it! You shouldn’t be ashamed” and the girl was denying it before storming out.

Now I could have stepped up and admitted it was me, but I was laughing at the situation so I didn’t.

So Reddit, am I the arsehole?",NTA. You saved that dude from the relationship with the bitchy girl who doesn't believe in farts.,"NTA, you had no part in the accusation and no obligation to incriminate yourself.",0,0
b2kqov,"Okay, so my wife and I are expecting our first child. She is 7 months along and we got an ultrasound yesterday to check on the progress (my wife’s medical issues caused the OBGYN to be extra cautious). 

During the appointment, the tech was pointing out our daughter’s different body parts, telling us where the legs and feet are. It was the first time we didn’t really need the help, because we could see our baby looking like a real baby. My wife started crying, and I was comforting her, when she said the words. “I can’t believe I’m making a human being.”

I kept comforting her, but I waited a few minutes and, once the tech was gone, gently reminded her that we are both the parents, not just her. I also told her that saying she’s “making” the baby on her own is not accurate, since I provided half the genetic material. 

My wife was still emotional at this point, and she started crying again thinking I don’t appreciate what she’s putting her body through to be pregnant. Obviously this is false, especially since her pregnancy has been so tough that I’ve attended at least two doctors appointments every month. I show her with actions, not words, that I appreciate her. 

I just don’t think it’s fair to claim I haven’t contributed something to making our daughter. She is still upset the next day. So, AITA?

b52zoa,"Note: My mother is paralyzed from the waist down, I also used to work with kids who have autism worse than his brother. His brother hates all women to the point that if anything touched by a woman goes near him it must be cleaned or removed. He is also very manipulative and abusive to everyone in their family.

Ok, so throughout our relationship my boyfriend's little brother frequently calls him in a panic asking for money or to get him things or take him places. This has gotten worse because he is back home for his last couple of semesters in college. Since he's moved back home his brother's demands have grown out of control where he runs out of my house to his brother's bidding. I used to (emphasis on used) go to their house every Friday to spend time with his younger sister and parents (his brother, like most autistic people, prefer to be alone), now almost every Friday they cancel or change plans on me last minute, I have ADD and anxiety so changing plans usually makes me upset but I also think that's a part of my personality.

One of the things my boyfriends family did to change plans on me last minute was decide to change plans, but not tell me and then alert me the day before around 10 pm (22:00) that I was to come to their house later because his brother wanted to go out to eat with just him, and it had to be Friday because Friday's are special. I just broke down at that point, my lizard was sick and I thought I was going to get to be with people who supposedly care about me. It was not my best moment.

His brother does a lot of things that I find really mean and rude. That says a lot because I worked with a girl who had violent outbursts and would curse at me but she never was malicious and his brother is. My heart hurts to see this 18-year old abuse their family like that.

Recently I told my boyfriend that his brother's behavior toward his family specifically his sister and mother was too much for me to handle, I said I was especially horrified that my boyfriend wouldn't tell his brother that you couldn't speak to your own mother like that. I said I would not be returning on Friday nights indefinitely and would only see his family if it was a large familial event like a wedding or reunion (we are Hispanic so it happens a lot). I've confided to my parents about this who both work with disabled people since my mom is one and my dad works in a clinic for people with brain injuries. They said this was something I couldn't avoid if I loved my boyfriend and wanted to stay with him.

My boyfriend also wants his brother to move in with us after he graduates college at his parent's request (I want to go into a grad program so I'll still be in school). Because of this, I have considered breaking up with him.

I know it sounds selfish but my heart is breaking. Am I a jerk for wanting my boyfriend to spend time with me that doesn't include changing everything around so that he can focus on his brother? I'm so conflicted and so hurt at the same time.

edit: clarity on who wants to move in with who

Edit: Thanks Everyone, I called him and we talked. It went poorly he said he never thought of how his brother treated anyone could be abusive but he knew he was an enabler. He said he never thought about how I would react because I am very comfortable with disabled people, considering it was my job for a while. He still wants his brother to move in with us at some point in his life but they are not going to try and give him therapy because they thought his behavior would improve as he got older and not get worse. At this point, I broke down because the only thing I could see in my head was a daughter we had getting treated like his sister and mother, or a son thinking it's ok to act like that and either be abusive or compliant. We are going to talk tomorrow because I started having a panic attack. 

Edit: thanks guys for your input you've made me realize I'm not being sensitive and crazy and that my feelings are not based on not getting attention but real issues like avoiding abuse and dangerous situations. I'm not sure what to do moving forward but it's really nice to not feel irrational  or crazy. ","NTA

cqn8jf,"Sorry for any typos for formatting issues, I’m on mobile 

About a week ago our family cat  went missing, we thought it might come back but for a few days it did not show up at all. We panicked and felt scared for our cats safety as there is a river semi-near us. Eventually, through the pound’s website we found hat our cat had been taken by the council. After we go her back, we needed to figure who did this. We asked around and found out that our neighbor had done it to other people in he neighborhood; give the cat to the council because it is on their property (which they can legally do) but not tell us at all, while they know we are worried. The main issue is that every night we were calling out the cats name, and they did nothing at all.

I thought of a idea for vengeance, it turns out that the neighbors garage is on our property, so I could cost them a lot of money by reporting this to the local council, as they would have to pay for inspection (or whatever it is called) and if the council says so, they will have to pay for the reconstruction (keep in mind this is a full brick-metal garage)

Will I be the asshole if I do this?

TLDR: neighbor handed cat into local council and never told us which made us panic, we will get back at them by making them renovate which will cost money

ewjuzv,"Some background: My older (technically half-)brother has been troubled his entire life. Severe ADHD, various personality disorders, child of divorce, and endless drug and alcohol use. The biggest thing was that he was in a drunk driving accident around 7 years ago and suffered a traumatic brain injury that massively screwed up whatever decision making skills and impulse he may or may not have even had. As well as magnifying the problems he already faced. I went through years of living with a crazy person who gaslighted, insulted, attacked, and threatened on a daily basis. 

This entire thing has put my family through the ringer and it’s just now that we’re starting to heal. He was finally put in a group home about a year and a half ago and I haven’t seen him since. 

Anyways, my mom came home from a haircut last night and told me about how she had been talking with the hairdresser (as you do) about her kids and she eventually says, “You know, you haven’t talked about your older son much? You said he was &lt;age&gt;?” And my mom gives her the lowdown and cries in the salon chair. 

At this point I laugh and say that when people ask how many siblings I have, I just say 2, my younger brother and elder sister. She didn’t appreciate that and said I was avoiding my problems and that we need to talk about them. 

Which I do? I see a therapist once a week and it’s not like my friends don’t know. I just dislike giving random people I meet the opportunity to learn about my Tragic Backstory™. 

It also annoys me that she does this a lot. We were at a big dinner over the holidays with some extended family, partially celebrating a distant cousin’s engagement. My mom spent a good portion of the dinner regaling this poor girl marrying into our family about our traumatic experiences. 

So my question is, WIBTA if I asked my mom to stop talking about our family trauma to every single person she meets? Please know that she doesn’t take criticism very well (it was a miracle when I told her to stop bad mouthing my sister last summer) and that this all might just blow up in my face. And while I do think it’s not that big of a deal right now, I don’t see it stopping and it’s only going to annoy me more the longer it goes on.","NAH. Maybe your mom’s grieving and her coping mechanism is talking about it to strangers. For the longest time, her identity was built on your eldest brother and his problems. 

You are free to cope in your own way and she should respect that you don’t want to talk about him anymore. Everyone heals differently and you seem like you just want to move forward from this, OP. Good luck.","A follow up comment: I really appreciate the helpful feedback. I know I can be cold sometimes. As for the bottom line WIBTA question, I've decided to shelve it for the time being since I meant it in more of a decade long time frame. 

I did also forget to mention that she regularly speaks at Mothers Against Drunk Driving events and court mandated victim impact panels for DUI convicts, which she finds some peace in. However, I think I'm going to encourage her (and my dad, probably) to start going to therapy again and we'll see how we are in a few years.

Additionally, I don't consider myself to be encouraging my mom to disown her son. She's definitely been upset with herself for not seeing him all that much lately, and if I could offer to go with her to see him, I would, but even the thought of it sends chills through me. In fact, the only things she tells me about him lately are the horrible texts he sends her, demanding money or yelling at her for ratting out the state counselor who was smoking weed with him. I don't know how to help my mother love and support her son when I can't ever consider him a brother again.",3,3
ax1omd,"So, I work at a clothing store and there is one employee that has smelled bad for the past 4 years. It's not like 'oops I forgot to wear deodorant' stink but a 'juice that collects on the bottom of a dumpster' stink. I honestly can't tell where the smell could be coming from but it is really bad. If she gets up from a chair the chair will smell just like her and any room she goes in smells absolutely terrible because of her. Every night we have to febreze the store because she stinks up the whole store. I've met her mom and dad before and they both smell perfectly fine.

I brought it up to my manager who said she had already talked to her 3 times previous because herself and other employees had a problem with her smell but she would speak with her again. My manager then spoke with this girl and I felt terrible because she came out of the office crying and left early. The next day she came back and she had no smell whatsoever. My manager said next time someone mentions the smell she will be going to corporate to speak about firing this girl or giving her some type of class on hygiene. Both of which would be embarrassing. Anyway, she smelled perfectly fine but this lasted for a week.

Fast forward to today, she smelled so bad that me and some other employees could not even stand to be in the same room as her. A customer came up and told me we need to wash the clothes because they smelled terrible but I know the customer was just smelling the girl she was standing next to. I plan on going and talking to my manager on tomorrow about calling corporate because it's gotten so bad. I feel bad because the girl is very nice but I literally can't even go near her because she smells so bad. I can't even understand how someone can handle smelling that bad. I don't feel like it should be my job to tell a 25 year old woman that she needs to practice personal hygiene.

az8vxg,"This happened a few years ago but it still makes me mad af. 

I was in 10th grade and it was already at the end of the school year and we were all looking forward to our trip to Barcelona. Sadly I wasn't doing very well at this time (severe d*pression, s*lf harm..). Two weeks before the trip I was so done, that I checked myself into hospital. I was released a few days later and was also doing a lot better plus I was very excited for the trip.
When I was back in school my teacher told me, that I wasn't allowed to go to Barcelona because of my mental breakdown. Somehow he was afraid, that I'm going to k*ll myself on the trip. This was absolute bs.
He even wanted me to bring a doctor's note, that I wasn't allowed to go on the trip. Instead I brought him a note, that said that it would be the best for me to go on vacation. He didn't care at all and shrugged it all off. 
Since this happened 2 weeks before the trip I wasn't able to get all my money back, so I spent 100€ for nothing.

I don't know if this is the right subreddit but I just feel like that it's my fault, that I wasn't allowed to go on the trip. If I had been pulling myself together this hadn't happened.

dnho8y,"So my girlfriend of almost 3 years has decided that she wants to become a stripper. 

The reason she wants to become a stripper is because we had a baby last year, she had a really great job that she had to quit. She said she doesn’t want to have to rely on me to pay for everything and she wants some independence. 

I told her that she can not become a stripper, I happily pay for everything for her because she is the mother of my child and I love her. The idea of other guys looking at her dancing makes me feel very uncomfortable. 

So my question is, am I the asshole for not allowing my girlfriend to become a stripper?","I mean all you can really say is you won't be together if she does it.

e3seys,"Background: Future MIL is traditional; my partner and I are not. She expects my mom to pay for my entire wedding and is appalled that I disagree with that logic.

We are getting married at the courthouse with only a small group (\~30 people) present and will have a larger reception to follow at an inexpensive venue (still looking). We decided to do the courthouse option because of the significant money it saves. My future MIL texted me saying that she should be able to invite whomever she wants because she's the mother of the groom and that her mom did that at both of her weddings. She also laid on the guilt saying that she will be sad/disappointed if she doesn’t have any of her friends there. I told her that I was not comfortable with having her friends at the wedding since I don’t know any of them and because they haven’t bothered to get to know me over the past 8 years my partner and I have been together. I also explained how it gets expensive having a higher count of people and we are trying to be mindful of costs. The conversation/argument somewhat escalated and she accused my partner and I of being too cheap and that we should elope if all we care about is money (but we don't want to elope).

dnvqfn,"Gave my husband a time out

Sorry for typos and grammar and formatting, on mobile. 

So my husband is sitting at the table with our 2.5 yr old and they’re eating grilled cheese together as I was tidying up the kitchen. Our son wasn’t eating his food anymore and pulling the sandwiches apart (as a toddler does) and my husband wasn’t impressed.  

Now I’m not sure why, maybe he did it to be funny or teach him a lesson I’m not sure, but my husband pushed our sons face into the ketchup on his plate. Now our son is obviously upset and has ketchup up both nostrils and all over his mouth and starts crying (duh!).

My gut reaction was to say (in a stern voice) (sons name!) because sometimes we mix up the names, my husband said “no no he didn’t do anything, it was me” and I said “I know.. it was an accident I meant to say YOUR name”... so then I say “daddy, that was not very nice and you need to have a time out” my husband looks at me like I’m ducked in the head but I look at him and say “please go, we’re teaching him bad behaviour is met with a timeout”.

When he came back I said “can you please say sorry to mikey for pushing his face in the ketchup?”. 

Now my husband is pissed because he says he’s an adult and he shouldn’t be humiliated like that. I disagree because we’re teaching out son that bad behaviour is met with a time out. So reddit AITA? 

I see his point of view... we are the parent and he is the child... but like he did something mean to our son? I dunno...

This is beyond bad behavior, your husband needs therapy and you should be looking for other BRIGHT RED flags like this one. I could not look at a partner the same if they did that to our child.","ESH you guys are supposed to be a united front, always.

dongmu,"I’m living in a student house and occasionally video call my boyfriend. Last night I called him from 10-11 which I don’t feel is particularly late and I had my headphones in. I’m not aware of being particularly loud and my boyfriend agrees I wasn’t. 

The girl in the room next to me told another house mate that I was being “very loud” even though she had to get up later than me the next day and so it was unlikely she was trying to sleep at this time. The friend who told me said it in a way that I should change it to not annoy her in the future. 

For context, when we first got the house there was a lot of disagreement over rooms. No one wanted the one in the middle including me because I didn’t want to be in between two rooms and have a higher chance of disturbing people. Long story short, we pulled names out of a hat and I got the reject room. 

Because of the fact I got lumped with the room I didn’t want for this exact reason, I don’t feel like I should have to be quiet, especially when it wasn’t even that late. If I was talking any quieter I’d have to whisper. 

The walls are definitely just thin because I’ve heard the person whose room is on the other side talk on the phone and have never mentioned it or been bothered by it because I feel it has to be expected in a student house. 

The girl who said I was being loud has so far not talked to me about it but if she does I don’t think I’m gonna apologise or act like I did anything wrong because I don’t feel I did but I don’t want to create a tense situation if I am in the wrong. 

TLDR: The person in the room next door complained I was being too loud on a video call, WIBTA if I didn’t change my volume in future?","YTA- 10pm is not an acceptable time to be loud. Other people are trying to sleep.  I would be so furious if a roommate was being loud at 10 (whether intentional or not). Saying ""well they have to wake up later than me"" is the most juvenile defense I’ve heard today.  You need to be more respectful to your roommates. You talk too loud. So either find a way to talk quieter or have the video call earlier in the day.","How loud you would be to your boyfriend, would depend on what his volume was set to, so that is largely irrelevant.

dzcpyx,"Kids are 8, 11 and 13.

This weekend my father in law came over to visit us, I don't have any issues with him as a person but lately some of his opinions have been bugging me. Whenever he sees his grandkids his main advice for them is ""enjoying life comes first, work comes second"". He says this because according to him, he made too many sacrifices for his job only to realize none of it was worth it in the end. I get what he's trying to say but at the same time I don't think this is a good message to send to a bunch of kids/teenagers for various reasons. The main one being that nowadays it's unrealistic to have this mindset. And I especially didn't want my kids hearing it. So once he left I told the kids to ignore the stuff he had said because it was nonsense. 

Yesterday I got home and my wife was PISSED. She heard our 13 year old telling a friend what I had said and she did not like it at all. She said that I had gone behind her back and taught our kids to be dismissive of her father and also of his experiences, just like I was being. I told her this wasn't the case and explained my reasoning behind it but she only got angrier. I told her that I had as much as a say in our kids' education as she had and her response to that was that I should teach them something better than being assholes.

b7yost,"So I have been working in my parent's bar and grill/cafe for as long as I can remember. There is an emphasis on steak, hamburgers, tacos, fish, etc, along with a lot of other meaty bar foods and sandwiches. We have practically zero vegan/ vegetarian dishes. We have exactly one now that I think about it, a simple veggie platter. My parents have been running this place for 10 years now, and we have earned a good reputation in the neighborhood as a local hotspot.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been attending college nearby recently so my hours have naturally dropped, but I am still a high ranking manager within in this grill/cafe. I will often handle the hiring process these days, as my mother is the head chef and my father is in ill health and trusts my judgement. I am a fair judge of character and have hired a lot of our best employees.

&amp;#x200B;

We have been searching for a new chef to take my mother's spot very soon, as she is getting ready to retire. A friend of mine recommended another friend of hers for the position, a recent culinary grad. I agreed to give her a fair chance and had her pass on a message to the friend in question to come in for an interview.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the day of the interview. She comes in with a good looking resume, but she has no actual job experience in the culinary field as of yet, only college. This isn't a dealbreaker for me, everyone has to start somewhere. As I start asking about her favorite dishes, she first makes it very clear that she is a strict vegan and begins to outline her favorite vegan dishes.

&amp;#x200B;

I am bit concerned at this point. I ask her if she is aware that we are a grill house/cafe with a heavy emphasis on meat. I ask her how she is going to taste the dishes if she can not/will not eat meat. She assures she me that she will just have someone else do it, but this does not work for me. We get very busy and everyone has their own express job inside of the kitchen. The head chef is responsible for all final tasting and quality control. It is an important duty. A chef who refuses to taste their own food might as well be cooking with a hand tied behind their back, as my mother put it later.

&amp;#x200B;

I end the meeting after a bit, talk to my parents about it, and end up calling her later and telling her that after our consideration we feel she would be better suited in a kitchen that suited her own tastes. She had a complete meltdown and hung up on me. My other friend then texted me up a storm, calling me an asshole, saying I should have given her a chance, she is having a hard time finding work as a vegan chef in this area, etc. After thinking about it for a bit I do feel bad, but I remain firm that she would not have been a comfortable fit in such a meat heavy environment. AITA?","NTA. The way you explained it just sounds like she wouldn’t be a good fit for that workplace. It might suck for her that she is having trouble finding a job but being vegan is her choice.

Being Jewish myself and planning a wedding, I can say with some degree of certainty that you are a bit confused about your role.

cyqrbp,"To start off, I am 24 years old man. My Tinder profile explicitly tells that I'm looking for long time serious relationships (that's quite normal at where I live).

&amp;#x200B;

2 months ago I met this 21 years old girl (let's call her Anna) who felt like the most trustworthy girl ever. You know the feeling when you instantly click with someone? Well we got that. However she said that she doesn't want to rush into relationship, which seemed perfectly OK. After all we knew each other for only 1 month at that point. Basically we talked almost 24/7, except when me or her were seeing our friends.

&amp;#x200B;

She was talking a lot about our future and seriously gave the feeling that she was interested in long term relationship. However, every time she was seeing her ""friends"", I had a small bad feeling that they're not just friends since she literally moved here 6 months ago. But I didn't talk to her about this, since after all we were not exclusive.

&amp;#x200B;

However 1 week ago, I started to talk that I'm getting super tired of Tinder, and would like to make things exclusive, at least for a month or so to see how it works for us. She started to act strange and basically said that she would like to continue same way as we have done so far. I felt that maybe I should just start dating again, but keep her as a friend for a while to see where it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

Last friday I was out with my friends, updated my Tinder profile and arranged couple dates for next week and she was out with her only friend (let's call her Sophia) that I really knew to be a real long term friend and a woman. 

&amp;#x200B;

At one point during the evening, Anna sent me a message that she most likely fucked up her friendship with Sophia. 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked what's wrong and Anna told me that the reason why she didn't want to make things exclusive was that she was seeing an another man who fulfilled some fetishes that she had (and never told me about them) At this point I was seriously wondering why the fuck would she tell me this.

&amp;#x200B;

We arranged a meeting for next day, where she basically tried to reason with me. The reason she told me, was that she was ready to go exclusive and felt that being completely honest was only way to regain my trust. She told me the guys name, where they met. He's 42 years old (Let's call him Dan) that she met in her hobby like +5 years ago. Then I asked why did Sophia get angry about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Dan has been in serious relationship for 9 months now. Sophia apparently doesn't like that at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't have a relationship with someone who doesn't see what's wrong in enabling an affair for that long time.

eg5vkx,"I (25f) have never gotten along with my dad (59m) who has been an alcoholic since I was 5. I have realized through lots of therapy throughout medical school that a lot of my insecurities and depression partially stem from how he has treated me over the years, from telling me that I am stupid and no one cares what I think when I was 10 to telling me that I am too judgmental to be a doctor this year. 

My mom has always told me that I am my dad's greatest pride in life and that he talks so positively about me to everyone he meets. My dad makes an effort to get along with me, from getting me nice gifts at xmas time to calling me to talk about random sporting events. However, this all falls apart on evenings we are together when he starts drinking and picks fights by commenting on my academic status, weight, and relationships.

Long story short, my mom's family is Mexican and my dad's caucasian family has always been critical of their marriage. Although I never got to know my maternal grandparents too well since they were very old when I was young, I have always been inspired by their fight for the American Dream while pushing their 8 children to receive a college education. Meanwhile, my paternal grandma was not very nice to me growing up as I look like my mom, but she may have had mental health issues of her own.

We have a time frame of 10-15 to deliver but most of the time it's always sooner. If something is wrong with an order we are more than willing to go back to the pickup place. We do not touch your order by any means. This one customer lives close by to most of the restaurants we do so his fee is the minimum every time. He always places big orders and is on the 3rd floor with no elevator access. All customers are aware they can tip when placing an order online and such it's an option before you check out. I really want to know if I'd be an asshole if I made a comment next time I deliver just so he could think about tipping. BTW his order equivalent fills up my largest bag which is more than half the size of me! 


EDIT:. Thanks for your feedback :/ I'm the asshole here. Will keep myself from commenting to the customer!","YTA. Just because it’s nice to give a tip doesn’t make it necessary. Even if you have to walk through the Himilayas and sail across the ocean, still not required. Should good delivery people be tipped? I certainly think so. But that’s his decision, even if he orders a lot and has a lot of money. Don’t make an aggressive comment. That could backfire very quickly.","NTA for wishing he would tip when he makes you lug that much food up three flights of stairs, but YWBTA if you say anything about his failure to tip to him. Tipping is a generosity mechanism. I would be furious if I didn't get a tip, and I always tip at least something when service is awful. Sometimes people have bad days. ",1,0
bci7t5,"Edit: I gave her $2400 out of $2471 in my bank account on Venmo before I made this post. 

Let it rain on me. Everyone else fucking has today. 

I claimed my exgfs two children and our newborn for 2018. 

She wanted half of my return, and then cheated on me/moved in with pill addict mom+dad. 

I got my return around March 15. I waited until now to get a new car and show up to her house in it. 

I spent my tax return on this new car, paid my debt off including debt she accrued on CareCredit, loaned my coworker $450 I’ll see next Friday, and paid my April rent. 

I also have spent 500-600 on weed. I want to say 400-500 but trying to be realistic. 


So I show up to her moms house to see the kids and her. We were on good terms. About to spend the day together. I tell her I have a surprise and show her the new car. 

She asked where her portion was, which I told her I could only give her $1500-2000. I told her all that I spent it on besides the loan+weed. I’m sure she will put two and two together regarding the weed even if I didn’t tell her. 

Anyways. Her mom busts out of her room and tells me I owe her money for her van she let us use while we had our newborn. I guess my ex is going to buy it for $800. 

Everyone is yelling at me, ex starts yelling at mom to go in her room. Mom refuses. Eyes are popping out while she’s swearing and yelling at me. All this is happening in front of our baby and 2/4 year olds. 

I stayed calm but broke everyone’s heart and saw their true colors today. Her mom doesn’t give a fuck about me besides my money. 

So yeah, ITA right?","ESH - you spent between 500 &amp; 600 on weed in a month? I mean I'm a smoker but that's excessive, and now these children get to live with other drug addicts.

djvsug,"I (m 40) have custody of my 15 year old daughter (Jenny) when I divorced her mom 13 years ago. Since then her mom has been wishy-washy at best in being involved in our daughters life. We live 2 hours away from each other. There was a 6 year period that she wasn’t around at all. No visitation, calls, cards, emails,...nothing. Our address and her school, activities never changed.  The last 3 years she has been better than the first 4 years before the disappearance but still not great. Sometimes she no-shows, or is several hours late. Sometimes she’ll randomly show up to get her and I had no idea she was coming. 

I pretty much let Jenny decide when she wants to go to her moms. I only ask that her mom let me know whatever plans she has with Jenny so I’m aware. I never hear from the ex and get a half or wrong story from Jenny even though I repeatedly ask her mom to please just tell me her plans. She still refuses.  

This year after school Jenny gets home with her younger half sister ( Stella) and they stay at my house until Stella’s mom gets off work to pick her up.  They’re home together for an hour and a half max. 

Two weeks ago Jenny’s mom has someone show up, because it’s never her, at 3pm on a Friday to pick her up for the weekend. I wasn’t home yet from work. Jenny calls me and let’s me know what is going on. Jenny had no clue anyone was coming. Stella gets off the bus a half hour later than Jenny. I made a couple quick phone calls and was bailed out by a relative that was available to pick Stella up off the bus. 

I immediately got ahold of Jenny’s mom. 

Me: Hey in the future when you make plans with Jenny I’d like for you to send me a text to let me know what the plans are as well so I can make arrangements if I need to. 

Ex: Oh sorry. I thought Jenny would tell you . 

Me: I’d just like to hear it from you a day ahead of time from now on or Jenny won’t be leaving the house any more. I don’t need specifics just please let me know that some one is picking Jenny up between 3-5 on Friday. That’s all I’m asking for. 

Ex: ok. I can do that. 

So two weeks go by since that conversation. Today I get a text from Jenny’s mom at 3 o’clock. Sorry for the late notice but someone is on the way to get Jenny. 

I immediately replied that sorry but she can’t go. I asked for a day notice and I get less than 2 hours. She made some comments about Jenny being a built in baby sitter and how it costs her a relationship with our daughter.  I replied that not being a constant in Jenny’s life for the last 13 years and never around for anything Jenny’s ever done has cost her a relationship with our daughter.  

So am I an asshole for sticking to my demand of getting a days notice before Jenny goes for the weekend?

Edit: I do know the people picking my daughter up. They are always her family members. They aren’t strangers.  Her mom is just never the one to get her or be in the car when she’s picked up.","NTA

e06veg,"I've (F) been friends with Peter (M) for almost 2 years, we met during our last semester of uni.

First off: Peter's very much gay, not interested in me sexually or the female body in general. Secondly: I'm just really not a prude.

When I'm friends with someone, particularly other girls and gay guys, I don't care that they see me in underwear and/or without a top. It's not like I flash people, I just don't see what the huge deal is if -gasp- they happen to sneak a peak of my nipples. And yes I know this is starting off as a weirdly specific post but I have to make some things clear because of what follows.

Basically, my boyfriend found out in an unrelated, roundabout way that Peter saw me topless last month when we traveled together (I changed my shirt while he was in the room).

Now boyfriend's angry I didn't disclose it. Meanwhile I feel crazy because it doesn't seem like something I'd have to bring up. Besides, another girl shared the hostel room with us, but my bf didn't even mention her as a problem. When I asked, ""well, what about K, does this mean you're jealous of her too?"" he started explaining how that's different because Peter's still a guy and it doesn't matter that he's gay.

How? That bit of info literally changes everything... Peter doesn't give a crap about my breasts. He's got his guy at home. My boyfriend doesn't care about that though. He insists I should've at least told him beforehand.

Reddit am I honestly being the unreasonable one in this conversation because I don't think that a gay friend seeing my breasts is that big of a deal?",NTA. Your boyfriend is overreacting. I don't think he considered the fact Peter would not be getting aroused.,"NTA. He doesn’t even know this girl’s sexuality, but he’s more concerned with the gay dude just because he’s a guy, it seems like. He has weird issues that read kind of like he thinks men have sole ownership of women’s bodies even outside of sexual situations. If the guy had asked to see you topless or something I could understand your boyfriend thinking he was actually a bisexual guy taking advantage, but this was totally non sexual and not something the guy had literally any involvement in. Your boyfriend is being pretty backwards about it.",0,0
dkucj6,"
My mom moved away and asked if myself and my boyfriend would take care of the renter's she was getting for her place. Knowing there would be a lot of work involved in this for not only myself but my handy man boyfriend I told her we would do it for a small fee per month. She said no. We moved on. Not long later she asked for us to do some work on the property. I reminded her of my condition and that we can reopen discussion on it. She said no. We moved on. This happened again later but this time resulted in her giving a guilt trip about her being my mom and it would be a nice thing to do for her. I didn't respond and we moved on. 

Well it's come up again. I told her no and that we've discussed it before. I received another guilt trip (which I haven't responded to yet). My boyfriend thinks I should do it to be nice to her.

So the question is why am I being so difficult? Like all of these things there's some back story. She's textbook narcissistic parent. I was certainly neglected growing up, as in her getting breast implants while I was wearing the same 2 shirts. When I was being bullied in school her response was ""maybe you should change your clothes"". I only recall her interest in my education once which was her telling the teacher he was responsible for me getting better grades then never bringing it up again. I always feared asking her something nice because of the giant sigh shed give me. As an adult my depression became full swing and her response was telling me to put my big girl panties on. When in therapy I asked her to come to try to explain what was going on, I told her I almost killed myself, and her response to that was to become hysterical (understandably) but only spoke to how this would have affected her. The fact I was that depressed was ignored entirely.

I could write a book on all the things. We've since become friends but I tend to skirt away from her when she tries to do mother things as I feel she tried to avoid being my parent my entire life. She missed it and I'm fine with being friends.

So AITA?","NTA. I feel like this is a ""give an inch, they take a mile"" situation. Backstory aside, when it comes to rental properties and the landlord not living in the immediate area, I feel it could easily fall on you guys to begin to handle the day to day dealings with the rental property.

co3xyq,"I work with at a restaurant in a mall with a girl named “Becky”. She and I are both 18 and we recently graduated from high school. She has been seeing a guy who works upstairs in a clothing store, “Jason”. I don’t know how old Jason is. I asked Becky and she said it wasn’t my business. If I had to guess he’s either in his late 20s or early 30s. He’s been gifting her jewelry and clothes from his job. Some of our coworkers have said this is creepy and predatory but Becky disagrees. Becky has told me that I am to tell no one about her personal business because it’s not my right and I agree because we’re both adults now.

I saw her mom at the gas station and she told me that she’s noticed Becky has put more effort into her appearance and asked me if there was a boy she liked or if she had a boyfriend. I didn’t lie to her and say I didn’t know. I just said it wouldn’t be right for me to put her business out there like that and she should ask her herself and I just left. 

In my opinion I think I should just continue to mind my own business and not get involved but on the other hand I can see how the relationship might be seen as predatory because Becky is still pretty young and he’s been giving her possible incentives to continue the relationship.

bm4zfc,"Apologies if this is not a more interesting story, but I'm a bit unsure of what to do, and an opinion would be really helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in the middle townhouse in a big row of townhouses, with a bedroom that faces a backyard, which is right up against the next row of townhouses. At night I hear neighbors come outside to smoke and sometimes there is light TV noises or kids crying, but never anything that has caused me trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

However, two years ago a family moved in who like to have their door open when the weather is temperate. That's fine, except that I go to bed around 10 pm. At 11 to 11:45 pm, they yell. Think like sportsball yelling. it comes and goes in waves so just as it settles down and I start to drift asleep, another sharp yell wakes me up. I don't know why they do this. They aren't angry or anything. I suspect the acoustics of the townhouses amplify it. But it wakes me up, and then I don't usually manage to fall back asleep until 1 or 2 am. If I go knock on the backdoor and ask them to shut the door, they just shut the door and say nothing, then do it again the next night. I've grown to hate the spring because it ends the night silence of winter. I don't enjoy having my bedroom window open at night for cool air because of this.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that I don't know if I am making a big deal out of something that just comes with living in a townhouse. But I also have been seriously considering talking to them, and explaining that my husband is a nurse and I have an hour commute, and we need to sleep, and that the sound carries to my bedroom and I can hear every word they say. The other problem is I've been seriously fantasizing that if they continue (and I suspect they will) telling them I will wake THEM up later in the night if they have in turn woken me up, which I already know is a bad idea (and I am certain would definitely make me The Asshole).

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm really asking is, AITA for finding this type of noise disturbing?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit for info:  

Here's some more details - I have not tried a white noise machine. I don't know if it'd be enough to prevent the sharper yells from coming through, and I don't think I'd like one, to be honest. But maybe it is worth a try.

I don't think it's a video game actually. The times I've been at the back door I've never seen a controller or anything. They do have a TV on though. There's also usually a lot of kitchen sounds at that time, like they're preparing a meal. I know this sounds weird but I think it's part of their bedtime routine. They have a kid and they seem to be yelling with the kid? The guy's voice is really deep and it carries.","NTA. You’re just trying to get some sleep. They’re causing a lot of noise outside. I’d say to go talk to them and just be honest about the noise and how it’s disturbing you and your husband’s sleep. If you are honest with them and they keep it up, then pursue further action.","NTA. You may need to have a talk with them about this eventually. If it's bringing ruin to your sleep, there's definitely a problem. However, don't ""fight violence with violence"" here.

dll0hq,"A little background info, I (25f) grew up in a rough household. Both parents were drug addicts, constantly in jail and so forth. Lived in a one bedroom trailer with five brothers. Grew up and also became an addict, I am currently five years sober living with my fiance in a hotel bc we have been trying to save money for a house. 

Well we got approved for a mortgage and we are house hunting. My mother (56) never really got her life together when my father passed away over 15 years ago. She lives with her abusive/drunk husband now and has for the past 6 years. We have a great relationship but its more of a friend/I'm her mom relationship. I have to help her with saving money and so forth. I love my mom more than anything and told her she could move in with me and my fiance when we get a house to get her stuff together and save up some money so she can make it on her own. 

Well my brother (30m) is currently homeless bc of his bad choices in the past. He sleeps in his car and gets a hotel room two nights a week out of his check. He has been sober for over eight months and I'm proud hes trying to get his life together. 

I mentioned to my mom that after a year of living with us and saving, her and my brother should get a place together to help each other, she was not happy. She asked me what I meant when I said after a year. I had told her previously that it would be temporary her living with us bc my fiance wants us to have a life and do our own thing and basically just be adults. She tried to guilt trip me and say she might as well stay with her abusive husband if I was just going to kick her out after a year. It worked and I do feel extremely guilty and have tried to talk to my fiance and just let her stay with us. He is very adamant on her only living with us for a short period bc he says she takes advantage of my kindness and walks all over me. 

I feel like a complete asshole for not helping my mother and brother more but honestly if she keeps this up then I'm just going to not help her at all.

Edit: I just want to say thanks to everyone for the advice it has helped tremendously. Me and the fiance talked last night and she will not be living with us. I'm not going to lie, I do still feel extremely guilty and upset but I understand I need to focus on me and the fiance.  Really thanks again everyone.","NTA. 

You’re not responsible for their actions. You shouldn’t have to take on their burdens. I think a year is a generous amount of time to be able to get themselves a place. You’re doing more than enough. Your mom is TA for trying to make you feel bad for suggesting (even though you don’t need their approval) they leave after a year. One thing I learned is you need to take care yourself first before trying to help others.","NTA

In the end, she's responsible for her own life. 

&gt;We have a great relationship but its more of a friend/I'm her mom relationship. 

I'm sorry, but that's *not* a great relationship - it's very unhealthy to have roles flipped like that. She was supposed to be your caretaker, and evidently failed in that role. That makes it even more unreasonable to expect you to be her caretaker now.

Not the closest friends but we had a few beers late and enjoyed watching a movie now and then but I was very busy with my new girlfriend so not time for my housemate but we could call each other good friends. 6 months ago his brother came and lived on our couch for three months after a bad break up. I felt bad for him and even helped him look for a job in the area. Didn't ask for a penny off the guy for bills or petty rent for alway being at our home.

&amp;#x200B;

Now he has GF and they decide to move in slowly without asking me. She contributed nothing to the bills and again I let it slide since we were on good terms and she always goes out her way to be nice to me. They ask me one night if its cool if they can take the apartment to themselves. I said no but I would think about it. Had a chat with my GF and we decided it was time for us to move in together too so housemate could take the house in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I get the new apartment signed for, deposit paid and even help my housemates girl move in, lugging baggage and driving across town. Finally time for me to move and everything is packed but then there is a delay of a month due to emergency renovation work (burst sewage pipe). I was given my first month rent back but since my girlfriend can't contribute to the deposit I had to pay it all. I have handed in my notice at this point and moving out date was officially 1st May. My girlfriend suggests we go on holiday for 2 weeks to her parents place and then move to the new apartment. Unfortunately her parents invited us for 15th may til 1st June. So for 2 weeks I officially have no where to live.

&amp;#x200B;

I explain the situation to my housemate and his girl and ask to stay as a guest for 2 weeks but to my surprise he just flat out says ""yeah so you owe us half a months rent and bills so you can stay otherwise its best to move today"". Not sure why this hurt so much when he said it but even his girlfriend was surprised since they had planned to turn my bedroom into a guest bedroom/storage room anyway. The girlfriend tried to offer resolve things but I just took my stuff and left for a local storage facility. Stayed with my GF until we went on vacation. Haven't spoken to him since. His girlfriend messaged me asking how the move went and if we were okay at our new place. I didn't reply.

I should probably mention that I think she may have some undiagnosed general anxiety. I thought that I was protecting her from more drama and more stress after we facetimed last night and she complained about stomach pain and not being able to sleep and all the ways her life was difficult, so I did my best to comfort her and didn't mention the procedure.

bwo3r4,"I earn a significant income and I expect it to grow more in the coming years. My investments will also mature in a few years in which I can expect to be decently wealthy. I’m saying this to emphasize that in an event of a divorce, I have a lot to lose. 

I have told my fiancé several times that I will not marry without some sort of protection or guarantee for my financial future. At the time she agreed, but now I think she simply said whatever it took at the time to get me onboard with marriage. She probably didn’t think I was serious but I certainly was and am. 

I talked this over with my lawyer and he drafted what I consider to be a pretty ironclad prenuptial agreement based on my concerns. He even suggested adding an infidelity clause which I didn’t think of, but certainly welcomed the suggestion. 

I talked this over with my fiancé and told her to go over the prenup with her lawyer to see if we can reach mutually agreeable terms. She got VERY offended that I even felt the necessity for one. To say she got upset would be an understatement. She was particularly offended by the infidelity clause. I certainly did not expect this reaction from her. She is now insisting that she will sign no prenups. 

Her reaction is making me have second thoughts. She claims that I’m not respecting our relationship and I’m expecting it to fail, which is not true. However, life is unpredictable and anything can happen at anytime so I’m just trying to protect my financial future in case of a divorce. 

I’m beginning to question everything after her response, especially to the infidelity clause. I thought we had a good relationship and never questioned her loyalty before, but why should she get so offended if there is nothing to hide ? It really feels like she would prefer to take me to the cleaners in the event of a divorce.

Keep in my mind, most of the terms in the prenup, including the infidelity clause also applies to me. She is more than welcome to modify it because I’m faithful and have nothing to hide. But at this point I’m planning on just calling the whole thing off. 

AITA ?","A prenup is fine, if it is discussed and agreed upon, and then drafted with both parties needs represented. 

However, it is rarely in a females best interests to agree to a prenup that is drafted with the sole intention to protect her spouses money in the event of a split. 

Most marriages produce a child or children. 

The female goes through pregnancy, birth, and often it is her career that takes the biggest impact due to having a child. As the saying goes, “women are expected to work like they don’t have children, and raise children as if they don’t have to work”. 

If your prenup is fair and representative of both of your needs, then it would be unreasonable for her not to agree. 

However, given how you went on about your wealth, protecting your investments, etc, I would be very surprised if you have included provision for any children, loss of career potential if she becomes SAHM, etc.","NAH.

I think there's perfectly reasonable and compelling arguments for being pro and anti pre nup. The issue isn't who is right or wrong here, it's about compatibility.

Also, as you accuse her of wanting to take you to the cleaners, I hope you realize how much an unsympathetic asshole you sound like. If you have so little trust in her, the answer is to *not get married.* She probably freaked out because she doesn't feel the same as you do about pre nups and she's on the side of the argument where it's hurtful, not because she wanted to fuck other guys and run off with their money.

b5zk48,"An old friend, let’s call him Dave, always stays at our house when he’s in town, and leaves it until the very last minute to ask if he can stay.  It’s always when a friend group birthday/event is coming up that he will wait until the day before to ask if he can stay... even though he’s had a month and half since he received the party invitation (this happens repetitively).  

Recently we were asked by a neighbouring couple to come over for drinks before we all went to mutual friend’s birthday.  We don’t know this couple at all, and they had asked my husband and I over a few times so we wanted to finally make that happen. We agreed to the plans almost 3 weeks in advance.  Dave, like clockwork, reaches out the day before the birthday to ask if he can stay with us.  I tell him that he is more than welcome to stay with us but that we have plans for a double date prior to the party and then gave him some alternative ideas of what he could do while we were with the other couple to keep himself occupied... like hanging out with another old friend in the city, going shopping at the mall etc.  When it comes to the time of the double date, Dave, just wants to hang out in our home alone and makes no effort to do any of the things he had said he was going to do.  After the party is finished he had apparently spent the night complaining to others that we had ditched him, and we should have invited him to the double date we had gone on, had it been him he would have never done such a thing etc...

Considering it was a double date, and we didn’t know the couple I would have thought it was rude to bring a random third wheel with us.... AITA here? ",NTA. You told him upfront that you had plans. It would be awkward to invite someone the couple didn't know. ,"NTA.  You are providing Dave with free lodging, and you are NOT required to make sure his entertainment needs are being met.

cnkhu1,"This happened about a couple of weeks ago, but the event has been playing non-stop in my head since then, so my memory of it is still very vivid. I will try to retell the story in a matter-of-fact manner, and let you guys be the judge.

About 2 weeks ago, I dropped by Subway to grab a quick lunch. It was extremely crowded, and all the people in line had to stand uncomfortably close to one another. Because of the proximity, I couldn't help taking notice of the man in front of me. Judging by his appearance, if I really had to guess, I would say that he was probably in his late 20s, perhaps early 30s. He looked well-groomed, and had a very fit physique -- it was obvious that he was someone who took good care of his health. He also looked like he spent a lot of time in the sun, judging by his conspicuous tan lines.

As I was letting my mind wander while waiting for my turn to place my order, I suddenly noticed that he had a few moles behind his right ear. One of them struck me as looking very abnormal -- it was asymmetrical, irregularly shaped, and seemed to have patches of dark brown and black. Even though I am not medically trained, I have seen enough pictures of melanoma to strongly suspect that he might be afflicted with skin cancer. He might not have noticed the unusual-looking ""mole"" himself, since it was located behind his ear. 

I was debating with myself whether to give him a word of caution. On the one hand, I did not want to come across as invasive and socially awkward; but on the other hand, if he was indeed ignorant of skin cancer risks, then he would probably appreciate knowing that he had at least one melanoma on his body. I began to imagine myself in his position -- if I were him, I would definitely want to know. Besides, as I said, he looked like someone who cared a lot about his health, so chances were even better that he would be grateful. I picked up my courage and tapped him on his shoulder.

Me: Excuse me.  
He: Yeah?  
Me: I don't mean to be rude, but... I noticed that there is a spot behind your ear that looks like a patch of skin cancer cells.  
He: What?  
Me: *(thinking that he didn't hear me correctly)* I noticed that...  
He: Are you a doctor?  
Me: No, but one of the moles on your ear highly resembles a melanoma. I have seen many pictures of melanomas, and I strongly suspect that you have skin cancer.   
He: Again, are you a doctor?  
Me: No, but, as I said...  
He: So no, you are not a doctor.  
Me: No.  
He: Well, since you are not a doctor by your own admission, you really should mind your own business instead of fear-mongering.

He then hastily turned around, clearly wanting to end the conversation. I was embarrassed, and, to be honest, annoyed that my good intentions were punished with chastisement. I later told a friend about what happened, and she called me an asshole for being presumptuous.

I thought I was being helpful, but I am beginning to doubt myself. So Reddit, AITA?","YTA - why not just say: Hey, I noticed you have a spot behind your ear that you might want to get checked? 

Not even doctors diagnose someone with *cancer* just by looking at moles. That was really inappropriate.","You’re not an asshole, people are being too harsh as per usual for this sub. Maybe next time try to say it in a different way—and don’t jump to the conclusion that he has cancer, you know? Just like, “hey, I noticed this spot behind your ear, it looks like it could possibly be harmful, maybe consider getting it checked?” That seems pretty reasonable to me.",1,0
elx77d,"So, I recently got into an altercation with my roommate because I told him his GF shouldn't be here when he isn't. He got very offended and as soon as he came home from work he got his girlfriend and stormed out of the house, stomping and slamming every door on the way out. 

When I initially addressed the idea I said something like, ""hey man, next time your gf is going to be at the house when you aren't would you mind letting me know? Ideally she would only be here when you are, but if it happens every now and then I understand, just let me know"". I felt I couldn't be more chill and understandable. 

It's his first GF in years and in general he is a very sensitive person so my gf and I half expected this reaction. I think part of the reason she stays here so much is because she doesn't have a car so he has to give her rides to her house and back. She might be at the house without him anywhere from once to a few times a week.

dvadid,"Just want to know, if I'm too demanding. 

I've worked with the artist before. I live an hour and a half drive from the shop, but wanted to book a session for a cover-up tattoo. I sent her all the material she needed, including the deposit and she said, she would have the design ready for the next day. We hadn't agreed on a date yet. 

My best friend has a session with her after this and my BF asked about my tattoo, because she knew, I hadn't heard anything. The artist said, she hadn't started, but she had the idea outline for it. I wrote her after 8 days and asked for an update and she said ""Sorry, looks like I haven't sent it to you. I'll send it as soon as I'm done with my costumer."" She then asked for my e-mail, because the file was too big to send over FB. I still didn't receive anything. 

I wrote her the next day about a date for the session and I asked for a time in mid december. She then didn't answer. I wrote her the day after that and said, I need to know now because of work. She answered and we agreed on a time and date. She them mixed me up with another customer, and almost got me to pay another deposit. I then asked about my design again, to make sure, I didn't give her a wrong email. She said, that she forgot to send the design and now they where on their way to a convention. I said just send it after that. 

My BF had another session with her after this, where she told her, that she hadn't prioritised my design, because my session was in december. She then started talking to her about how she had planned a design for my whole shin, even though we havn't agreed on this at all. But I still just waited for her, to send over this design, so we could talk about it. 

Well, then I broke my braces and it's going to be pretty expensive to get it fixed, so I wrote her again last thursday after two weeks of silence. I asked for a price. I said, I maybe had to postpone out appointment, to prioritise my dentist bill. Still no answer, even though, she's seen my message. I then wrote her again yesterday and said, if she couldn't give me an answer, I would have to cancel the session to be sure, I had money for the other bill. I was also honest about how frustrated I am about her communication. I told her, if the project was too much for her to handle, it's totally fair. Well guess what then happened. She saw the message, but didn't answer. 

I really just want it cancelled at this point, but I also don't want to feel like I've wasted 75 dollars on nothing, especially with Christmas coming up and my dentist bill. I'm a student working quite a bit of hours a week, so that I can afford things like tattoos.

cym7p0,"I (26F) have been in an LDR for almost 3 years now. My boyfriend is Bulgarian and I am American. Due to financial and job constraints, we have been unable to officially close the distance but are planning to have him apply for American visas next year. 

My cousin, Beth (28F), has ALWAYS been very dismissive of my relationship. My family is close and due to our close age, Beth and I were always friends growing up. We are good friends apart from her constantly picking on my relationship and dismissing its validity. She would frequently say things like ""When are you going to get a real boyfriend?"" and often refers to my partner as my mail-order-husband.I have always been very civil but firm on the subject and she knows I dislike when she says things to belittle him or our relationship.

Beth recently got a new boyfriend of her own. She then started lamenting to me about how she now ""understood"" my pain and struggles of being in an LDR. She apologized to all the belittlement and started complaining about her new relationship because it's long distance. How far is her boyfriend, one might ask? Well, he lives 30 minutes away. Neither of them have overly demanding careers that take up a lot of their time, and they go out at least once a week. She frequently stays at his place over the weekend and will drive to work on Monday morning from his apartment.

In her eyes, because they do not live in the exact same city it's an LDR. Now, I hate gatekeeping as much as the next person, but in my eyes it's not an LDR if you can see each other every day of the week and it's a 15 minute drive to meet up half way. Seems pretty normal for a relationship. It takes longer for people in the same city to meet up sometimes, but we live in a rural area with no traffic whatsoever so it doesn't even take the full 30 minutes to get to his place most of the time.

When she kept *accusing me of belittling her struggles with LDR* (oh the irony) I blew up a little. I told her that her relationships ""isn't fucking long distance"" and she still cannot understand a single thing I have to go through being in ""a real LDR"". She called me a gatekeeping bitch. Her younger sister (who I am also good friends with) called me to tell me I shouldn't have made Beth feel so bad when she was trying to be understanding of me. I don't think I'm gatekeeping. Maybe I'm an asshole for blowing up over it, but when she pretends to understand it feels so patronizing, especially after all the shittalking of my relationship before. Am I being an asshole here?","NTA

I always had a crush on a girl in my old high school, for the sake of anonymity let's call her Jane. I always fantasized about Jane but never really had the courage to talk to her, she was in many of my classes and I still never talked to her. At the end of last year I decide to just finally message her over text and found out that she is going to the same university as me, we texted for a long time and eventually started meeting in person once the university semester started. We got along so well it's unbelievable that we were not best friends in high school, I've never gotten along with someone better in my whole life, we never run out of topics to talk about and the conversation is always interesting. All of this happening so fast made me very excited until I found out that she was already seeing someone. She told me she is in a long distance relationship with a guy in another country and that they'd been dating for 3 years.  At the start, hearing this news did not bother me, we got along so well that I was happy being friends with her - although, I did still have feelings for her.  I loved spending time and hanging out with her.  We spent ever single moment of free time we had during university with each other. Eventually the topic of crushes was brought up and I did admit that I had feelings for her. She told me that she also shared these feelings and at this point our relationship started to become more romantic. We started doing small things such as holding hands but it quickly over a few weeks progressed to making out and sleeping with each other (not sex just cuddling and sleeping next to one another).  Problem is that while all of this is happening Jane always tells me how horrible she feels for doing this and how it makes her feel like a liar and cheater to her boyfriend, it even brings her to tears sometimes. I love her with all my heart and she's expressed that she loves me too but I can't help but feel that I am the root issue of her pain and suffering. I'm not always the one making the moves, she gave me the first kiss and was the first to many other things, this relationship is two ways, its not just me making move on her and forcing myself on her.  I really don't know If I am the bad guy here, please help.",ESH. You're the asshole because you got romantically involved knowing she's in a relationship.

ckzegu,"I have been with my partner for 2 years. Throughout our time together, I have expressed a handful of times , maybe a little more, behavior of his that I don't like. 

Recently, I expressed to him that I don't like certain profanity. Other things that I have mentioned in the past include not agreeing with him leaving out details during his days trips with female friends because he assumed I would be jealous and him not supporting me for an important event.

We had a phone call earlier tonight and I told him that it bothers me that he thinks that me expressing things is unexpecting or surprising. He said "" when I tell you things that bother me about you are you shocked? No right? Cuz I do it often enough that it doesnt surprise you"" I said ""you may say things more than I do but I have opinions and values. Do you think I dont have opinions or values?"" He said ""Its not that I dont think that its just that you have always been so chill about everything and so when you say something bothers you, yes its unexpected"" I said ""I can be chill and have opinions and values at the same time"" and he said the way I've presented myself up to this point has been a certain way and so its shocking and I asked him how is it exactly that I've presented myself and he couldn't explain.

d8huug,"Allow me to explain. Last Sunday I hit up a club in my university (card, board, video game club) and chilled out for a bit as per usual on the weekends when someone I hadn't seen before shows up. There were around 7 of us chilling out in the room all playing a variety of games (mostly smash) and I'm noticing this new guy is coming onto me *hard.* He goes to dap me up, holds my hand for far too long. We go to do team battles in Smash and he immediately asks to team with me not knowing how well / good I am. He eyes me down after he loses his stocks (lives, basically) and is practically looking at me moreso than the screen. 

You get the point.

By the end of night (about an hour later) he asks for my Snapchat handle, and I shrug and give it to him (other guys I had just met were doing it too, didn't think much of it. The moment I'm back in my dorm, he asks about my sexuality. I end up saying I'm asexual and he just re-asks the question, so I just tell him I'm straight and that I'm not interested in a relationship with anyone. He then proceeds to ask me out, usually wanting to chill alone with me, specifically around midnight for the past two days. He backs this up with telling me he's been looking for a friend with benefits for a bit and clearly does nothing to conceal the fact that he's aiming for me. As of last night, I've pretty much gone dark on Snap with this guy after telling him three times that I am ace and specifically not gay nor bi.

Note: I dont want to start a discussion around surrogate mothers, I respect every posture and I think it ends up to the specifics, so please, keep that in mind when commenting.

We’ve been married for 10 years (M40-F32) and have two children. About 5 months ago my sister in law (I’ll call her Donna) and her husband(Jake) started “joking” around with us about the chance of my wife being a surrogate mother for Donna (39) who was recently told by 3 different medics that she cannot have kids on her own. I didn’t like the tone of the conversation but did not mention anything as it was a “joke”.  3 months passed and the jokes became a direct ask (to my wife only) from Donna and Jake, her mother, Jake’s Mother  and a “close friend”. When my wife and me started to discuss this we both agreed it was the best to gather everybody together to decline (we scheduled it for spring-break as all we live a couple of flights away from everybody). 

From time to time we talked about our decision,never changed our minds, but discussed the situation. During one of this talks I mentioned I did not agree due to different factors(my wife agreed on two of them):
- Pregnancy is not a game, mother/baby life are literally on risk.
- Although Donna and Jake always mentioned they would cover the cost of everything, what would happen if at some point they just turned around and said “we changed our minds”. (Not to mention we have no idea of the legal implications of the process)
- Some background on Donna: she decided not to have kids until now, when my first child was born there was this small talk around her plans for family and she told us that it was not in her plans(not with Jake yet) because she wanted to travel and meet all kind of different places (which she did), when my second child was born she (and Jake now) told us the same and even said they were not sure they wanted to become parents. I’m not judging her decision, I’m just mentioning the fact that pregnancy becomes more difficult with age and that is something you need to consider if having family is on your plans.

Last week we announced them we would decline their offer and everybody just froze, when we gathered them they thought we would announce we were accepting and this shocked them. Her family started blaming me and my wife about it, saying the common “family first” speech. They made us feel like shit and we decided to leave. I’ve been receiving calls every 2-3 days from Donna, Jake and all her family saying that I don’t have a word on it (even we are married and she is the mother of my kids) that she should be able to decide this on her own. during one of this talks with Donna I mentioned the reasons why I didn’t wanted to do it and she hung up on me and since then all her family completely shut down communication with us (not complaining on my side), but it affected my wife and the kids also started to ask why they dont get calls from her grandmother. AITA for telling her?


[Edited to add info on what I told to Donna.]

While I was explaining that we had two childs and didnt wanted to take any risk on my wife health she just kept interrupting me with “facts” about how small that chance was in the present time, and just kept talking about all her research. I got tired of having my(and my wife) actions questioned and told her (not verbatim): “This is a personal choice, I don’t like to justify my actions as I don’t like to ask for other people justifications. You and Jake decided to wait until now to have a family and we respected that can you do the same and respect our decision?”- that is when she hung up on me.

[Edited to add more info on why we told everybody and not only Donna and Jake]
The first call from a third party was from my wife’s mother. She started the conversation (according to my wife) with “we talked to your sister and she told us they asked you to....”- nobody else knew at that point so we assume this is true, then Jakes mother and then my wife (and sister in law) friend. At that point this became a regular topic during any call, we thought it would be a good idea to let everybody know at the same time as everybody was involved at that moment (not by our choice) and also because we felt it would make them feel better to have this delivered face to face. Huge mistake, but we never thought they would react the way they did.

[Edited, adding clarification]
I think there was a confusion, we always talked to them together. The initial approach was with my wife only but they didnt looked surprised when I mentioned it, so I just assumed they were relying the communication through her. My wife was clear on her position , they just assumed I was behind it. (I think they still do)

e1bc7s,"My daughter has been wanting a breast augmentation for some time now. She’s still 1.5 years away from her university graduation. My husband and I pay for all of her expenses: tuition, books, rent, and money for her food and other miscellaneous expenses. We had planned to financially support her until graduation. We have given her lots of allowance since she was little. She must have at least 5 figures saved up. 


She brought up on the phone last month about going to a surgery consultation. I sympathized with her wanting the procedure, but I made it perfectly clear that if she goes through with the surgery, then she wouldn’t be needing our financial support anymore. My husband agreed at the time. She can get a part-time job and take out school loans like most university students do.


She came back yesterday for Thanksgiving break. She has been wearing the same oversized sweater since she came back. Needless to say, my husband and I were suspicious. After she came back home from a long day with her friends today, I asked her to prove to me she didn’t go ahead with the surgery already. She was flustered and trembled when she told me she didn’t have the surgery yet. I went to her closet and pulled out a small t-shirt and told her to put it on and come out to show me. 


She broke down in tears and admitted to getting the surgery. My husband rushed over and asked us what happened. I told him about my test to prove whether our daughter has done the surgery already. He told me that I went overboard and hugged our daughter. I brought up the conditions we discussed earlier, that we would cut financial support if she got the surgery. 


My husband went back on his agreement with me. He told our daughter that we would continue to love her forever and financially support her through university. He makes all the money so I suppose he gets the final say. After a long hugging and bonding session with our daughter, my husband told me once again that I went overboard when I made her prove to me she wasn’t lying. He thinks I should have just believed her when she said she didn’t have the surgery.","YTA - You knew your daughter had money saved up, and you knew she could afford stuff before the surgery anyways but you kept on paying. Your problem is the fact that you didn't want her to get the surgery, not the money. And the testing is creepy and odd","YTA. Your daughter went through a whole ass surgery...SURGERY! AND hid it from you because of how unsupportive you were when she expressed her insecurity and wanting of breast implants. You basically told her you’d rather her go into debt for her education than get the procedure done that she saved up for. Then, you embarrassed her with that test. My mom actually paid for my breast implants. She drove me there, waited the couple hours it took, drove me back, got all my pain meds, took care of me, cooked for me, and everything. It’s still surgery even if it is elective. I couldn’t imagine how much more difficult it would’ve been if she hadn’t been there to help. While I understand that the money wasn’t meant for something like this, I would suggest talking to her to see how she feels about herself now. I know some people do get carried away with plastic surgery but for me, I felt so much better about myself. I had a lot more confidence and I felt so much more comfortable in my skin. It was like I was able to be more myself and I’m really happy I got it done. I’m hoping that your daughter feels the same way and wouldn’t you want your daughter to have more confidence if that’s the case? But if she’s going to be punished for this nearly permanent decision then that’s going to affect how she feels about them.",1,1
dzl7ad,"Every year my dad's side of the family does Thanksgiving at my aunt's. I've never been close to my dad's side but I've been trying more lately. I've never gone to one of these dinners bc I always do Friendsgiving or go to my mom's side, but they're all dead now. Fyi, As far as I know, my aunt is mentally and financially ok. She's personally clean and wears nice clothing.

In July my aunt had a bbq at her house and I went with my 3yo,my dad, brothers, and a few cousins. So, my aunt has never kept a super clean home, but it was always just messy, not nasty from what I remember, anyway. Well i went there for the first time in about 20 yrs for the bbq this summer, and I was appalled at the level of grossness. I'm talking full on ammonia stench from the cat, stuff all over the place, stains of unknown origin on walls/ceilings. The kind of place you're afraid to touch anything. The house is huge and used to be beautiful, but at this point it would have to be gutted it's so gross. I was extra horrified bc last year I let my dad bring my son there for Thanksgiving when I had the flu bc obviously I didn't know it was so filthy. I don't think this place is safe for adults, let alone kids. My brother thinks I'm overreacting. Which is weird bc he's a clean freak, and very finicky about his home and appearance.

We stayed outside bc it was a bbq but when we had to use the bathroom, I took my kid and the bathroom was next level nasty. Mold, rust, soap scum, rotting shower wall, stains on walls and ceiling, disgusting toilet, old toiletry stuff everywhere. I gagged from the smell. I hid my gag and tried to downplay the filth when my son said it was smelly bc I didn't want him to say something rude on accident when we got back outside. It was so gross, we didn't wash our hands and just used my hand sanitizer after. I literally didn't want to touch the taps.

My family wants me to go this year, but I really don't want to. Summer is one thing bc we can stay outside, but we'd be stuck inside bc it's Nov in New England (USA). AITA for saying no and telling my brother why? (He's the one who asked if I was going.) Ever since I told him that I wasn't sure about going, it's been radio silence. I feel like my aunt's gross house is this huge elephant in the room. I can't be the only one disgusted by it, yet nobody says anything. My bro is not close to my aunt so I'm not *exactly* sure why he's offended but he's a ""my way or the highway"" kind of person and was diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder last year. He refuses medication. He is slightly scary and very moody and it took me hours to work up the nerve to tell him I wasn't going. So he could just be mad that I'm not ""going with the flow.""

AITA or should I suck it up and go? It bears mentioning that I don't have a car bc I live in a city, so I'd be at the mercy of my brother or dad for a ride home (my aunt lives 90 mins away)

TLDR; I don't want to go to Thanksgiving bc it's in a gross house, brother is mad about it","NTA. Who wants to spend the day in, and be expected to eat in a home that is filthy?","NTA.

cq4kkx,"Today I had just about had it. 

I work from home and live in a house with roommates, and I loathe the entire situation. We're moving out September 1st and it couldn't come soon enough. Usually the days are fine minus some craziness from the four dalmations left in the house, but occasionally someone (roommates tinder date, or most commonly - the roommates family members) will stir about. 

Sometimes it's fine when the mom comes, even if it is just a little crazy that she comes in as she pleases. I just keep my door shut and try to avoid communication. But recently (mom is a contractor) she has been doing renovations on the house during the weekdays when I work. This is not okay, and I've never been given notice. The last time it happened she was told it wasn't okay, but clearly disregarded that memo.

Today, I'm extremely sick with a cold but had put off some deadline work that needed to get done. No biggie, until I see three giant vans careen down the street and park in the driveway. 

Long story short, they immediately begin hammering, about 4-5 people, into the walls and ceilings. I went out to get some food delivery and was greeted, and I just rolled my eyes.

An hour later, the power goes out in the middle of work. I am a web developer and many of my connections rely on a stable internet, which is why I pay the bulk of it's cost. So the router is shut off and lo and behold, about an hour of data entry is gone. I brush it off to be non confrontational, until two hours later it happens again, when I was napping. No harm no foul, but I prepared what I would say if it happened a third time. They were quiet and I was unsure if they were still there, but an hour later while I'm redoing all of my work from the first time, the power goes out again.

I go out and said ""can you PLEASE alert me if you're shutting the power off? It would only take you a second. You know I'm here and it's unfair that I have to keep redoing my work.""
He replied ""you don't own this house. I don't care if you're working or not."" Dumbfounded by a clear as day asshole, I started screaming (frankly losing my shit) for him to get the F out, and started throwing his and his buddys tools out the door. He then calls the mom, who says they can continue working and I get no reprise.

Later, my roommates sister drops in trying to be funny to me about the situation and I basically unloaded on her about the worker and the mom, and she said she's glad it happened because IM the asshole.

The roommates have not spoken to me about it. AITA?","I’d love to hear your roommate’s perspective on this because her reaction does not make sense to me. Clearly you were disrespected in your home (you pay rent it’s your home), and the situation sounds ridiculous. NTA","

e8yzrm,"I’m a 4th grade teacher. For our Christmas Party this year, I sent home a note letting parents know we would be having a cookie swap. The requirements were: there must be 18 cookies (enough for everyone plus teacher and para to take home a cookie), cookies must be homemade, cookies must be nut-free, and that since I’m gluten free, some gluten free cookies would be great but optional! I also requested that parents email me the recipe so I could compile them into a book and hand them out to all the kids. I also promised to supply the paper plates for the party. 
 I followed up with an email letting parents know that gluten free cookies were encouraged but not required so that no one felt obligated. 

The kids are so excited and talking all about how they can’t wait to make the cookies! They all want to make gluten free cookies for me- how sweet! 
Today, I sent out a reminder to parents about the cookie swap and emphasized that they must be homemade, nut free, and that gluten free was not required. I also reminded them to send in the recipe via the google form I created. 
I received a reply from a parent suggesting a card swap instead. She said that 9 year olds cannot bake, so the requirement of homemade cookies falls upon the parent, and that because there were so many food restrictions, and it was in the middle of the week, it was extra burdensome. She mentioned that other parents also felt this was stressful. 
This is the first time I have received negative feedback on the cookie swap in 3 years so I want to know, AITA?","if the cookie swap is not optional, i think YTA.

this should be something you GET to do, not something you HAVE to do.

also, i have concerns about your requirements:

* homemade: why?! you just made it a bigger burden.  i thought it was common practice to have a ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy regarding cookies being homemade or not.  you're also stopping someone from purchasing really amazing cookies form a shop, as well as stopping people without the time
* nut-free: why?!  you didn't mention that anyone had allergies, so you're just stiffing the variety out of personal preference it seems?  am i missing something?
* gluten-free: you really shouldn't be pushing this on other people.  it's your choice, let people make their favorite cookies.  the fact that you say ""gluten free is optional"" still puts pressure on people to be gluten free. if it's optional just dont' say it",YTA. Not everybody has the time or the talent to bake cookies. But especially the time.,3,0
bgfyg8,"I'm really new to Reddit. I heard about this sub through YouTube and thought it'd be a good place to go to help resolve this. Apologies if anything is wrong re: formatting etc. 

I'm a bi dude in a relationship with another dude. We've both got kids from prior relationships, one of whom is my 9 year old son of whom we have custody. His mother is a deadbeat who neglected him pretty severely and ultimately chose her party lifestyle and toxic relationship over her child. He's 9 years old now, has lived with us full time since he was 4 and his mother hasn't even attempted to make contact since he was 5. Of his own volition, he began calling my partner ""Dad"" a couple of years ago and now tells people he doesn't have a mum. 

One of our neighbours is very conservative, and has made it plain in the past that she doesn't approve of our family unit. She's rarely overtly unpleasant these days, but she makes annoying subtle comments to our kids that have been rubbing me the wrong way for a while. For instance, if 9yo refers to my partner as his dad, or my partner's kid as his brother, she'll make a point to correct him like ""you mean *step*dad"" or ""*step*brother"". I politely asked her if she wouldn't mind stopping that because, not only do I loathe what she's implying, it really upsets my boy. She's argued this with me saying it's not right for a child to have two fathers and I'm poisoning my kid by allowing him to think so. 

The final straw came a week or so ago when she overheard my boy explaining to another kid that he doesn't have a mum. She went on something of a rant about it, saying my son *does* have a mum and that everyone has to have a mum and a dad because having two of one of them is wrong ethically and biologically impossible anyway etc. My 9yo came running home bawling his little eyes out and I was reliably informed of what was said by another neighbour who stepped in to tell this chick to fuckin stop. I went over there and essentially just yelled at her that she's a fucking disgusting bigot and that she has no business being near kids if she's going to try and force her shitty dogma on them and that I never want to catch her talking to any of my kids ever again. 

Now I appreciate that I lost my cool and that yelling at her wasn't the best course of action but I was seething because she made my boy cry like that. However, she's recently started chatting to other neighbours saying *I'm* the bigot for not allowing her to express her views, claiming I'm trying to impede on her right to free speech and that I as a man had no right to ""threaten"" a woman (to be clear I did not threaten her directly, just told her I don't want to see her speaking to my children). For the most part my neighbours agree with me that she's fucking cuckoo but a couple of them have told me that she's right that she should be able to have her opinion and express it however and to whomever she wants. Am I the asshole here?","NTA. That woman sounds horrible. Is there a reason to even keep communicating with her? I get that she’s your neighbor, but I would mostly avoid her if she’s going to be a homophobic bigot who is upsetting a child. Your neighbors who defend her don’t sound all that great, either.","Fuck no you’re not the asshole. You laid down the line for that closed minded fool, that she isn’t to talk to your son since it hurts him. If anything SHE is the asshole. She has no rights telling your son anything. She may have freedom of speech, but that doesn’t give her the right of way on every discussion. Why is it that religious people have to force their ideals on everyone, yet scream oppression the moment someone levies any criticism on them.",0,0
dfokc6,"I've been waiting forever to watch it. We watched up to S6 together and he really enjoyed it, but then we went through a busy time in our lives and he would pass out from sheer exhaustion whenever I put on a show, any show. So unbeknownst to him I finished S6 and S7 at my mom's house when I went to visit. When he found out I watched the end of S6 b/c I slipped and said something like ""wait you have to see this next part!"" when we were watching it (again for me) together, he got kinda pissed I watched it without him. 

I've been acting like I've been waiting to watch S7 and then finally S8 with him, but I'm dying to see the last season at this point. Tonight I downloaded S7 for us to watch and he fell asleep right after dinner. We've been ""trying to finish GoT"" for over a year now, I should mention.

Can I just watch it without him at this point? Or should I keep waiting cuz we said originally we'd watch it together back in the day?",Do yourself a favor and just stop where you’re at.

cjzjtt,"Last  Saturday I met a friend for a couple beers and a bite at the local pub around 7pm. We talked about what to do that night, I mentioned wanting to come back to the same place in a few hours for some live music. He says that he needs to set up some equipment and it's a 2 person job, he asks if I'd be willing to come help. I agree knowing that setting this equipment up is basically like putting up a tent and I have a couple free hours. To say thanks he covers my bill (about $21 CAD).

Upon getting there I find out that it's going inside a closet that isn't cleaned out, so I start helping him move heavy boxes and things from the  top floor to the basement for about an hour, then it turns out there are shelves in the back of the closet that need to be unscrewed and removed from the wall to make room. Again, I carry all the shelving downstairs, collect all the screws, etc. At this point it's been a solid 2 hours, music started at 10 but it's always late starting so I told him he had me until 11.

He got upset saying I agreed to help him and he covered my bill, and he wouldn't have a lot of free time this week to do it. I said all he asked was for me to help set it up, and that I'd been there doing work that he could have done himself prior, or at least  mentioned beforehand when I agreed to it. He said it shouldn't matter how long it takes and I should be happy to help a good friend with their  project. I reiterated that I would be happy to come back and help some  other day but I wanted to enjoy my Saturday night and had prior plans, and that I'd be leaving at 11.

11:00 arrives, he says there's still more to do prior to setting it up. I said I'd come back the next evening when he's free to finish it, I just wanted some prior notice. He agreed and I thought we were good.

Sunday rolls around and I don't hear from him. He's the kind of guy to make  plans one day then have something come up with work or a date and  bail/just not mention it, so I figured this was one of those times until Monday when I get a text saying ""Really dude? Bail on helping me for bar music then completely ignore me the next day  (neither of us talked at all the next day?) even after I paid your tab?""  I reminded him he didn't message me and he said I should have ""checked in"". He said he felt like I bounced the second I saw work to do so I guess he thinks all the boxes, shelves, etc just floated down to the basement themselves.

I'm upset  because I feel like he misled me to the amount of work then tried to  guilt me when I called him out on it, but maybe good friends are  supposed to just be willing to do stuff like this for each other on a whim? AITA?

TL;DR: Agreed to help a  friend set up equipment, turned into a many hours long project of  hauling and renovating and I left after 2 hours with it incomplete to go  do my original plans, friend now accusing me of being ungrateful and lazy.","NTA, he really should've cleared up that closet earlier or at least started it.

dnr45t,"I (16f) don't live with my dad. I see him maybe once a month for a day or two, it's been that way for years. But recently he's won some money and decided to take me and my brother on a 3 day trip. It's the longest we've spend with him in years. 

Honestly, it was fun. One big problem though, he's a 'bad' tourist. Taking off his shoes on the plane (it smelled bad. It was only a 1.5 hour flight). Listening to music without headphones on the plane. Keeping his luggage on the bus seat when it's so full other people have to stand. Listening to music loudly when walking though a residential area late at night. Causing a scene for things 'he could do at home so he didn't know he couldn't do them here' (after being told he couldn't). Getting very drunk right before our flight and ""flirting"" with a stewardess. He was a few euros short when buying something and took them out of the tip jar. People where glaring at us for most of our stay there. 

That's just off the top of my head, there's more. It was uncomfortable and awkward. 

After we got home to our mom, he said something like ""it was fun. Let's do it again soon"". I thanked him for the vacation, thanked him for taking us with him, but told him I'd prefer not to travel with him again. After he asked why I just said ""X Y and Z made me feel uncomfortable"". 

My dad is very pissed. My mom thinks I'm right (but anything negative I could say about him she'd agree with, so that's not reliable) and my brother is torn between the two, he felt embarrased with my dad but doesn't want to complain either. 

AITA here?

Edit: I tried to ask him to stop doing those things in a subtle way. For example: ""Oh, maybe people are trying to sleep. It's pretty late."" I didn't tell him directly to turn off the music, or stop doing other obnoxious things.","NTA. You did it in a respectful manner. Voicing your concerns is a good thing, maybe your father will learn from this.","NTA. If you listed how behavior X, Y, Z made you uncomfortable, as a matter of fact, that's not being an asshole. You feel the way you feel about it. Stating it might hurt your dad's feelings, but OTOH, he's not planning on changing his ways, so...

Unless your dad demands an apology (which again, you just told him how you felt, so I'm not sure what an apology would accomplish), just let it drop for a while, and if he brings up travel again at some future point, you can counter with: ""Dad, I'd rather the next time we do a staycation. I think everyone might be more comfortable that way anyway.""",0,0
eoaq50,"An old friend from school who I’m friends with on Facebook is currently on holiday in South Africa. Today she posted pictures of herself with a cheetah (collar around its neck and leash being held by a worker). I posted a couple of links as to why this practice is cruel (one of the links was about the specific place she attended). I was immediately jumped on by her friends. I stayed polite and left the conversation, wishing her a good holiday.

She has now messaged me saying that I should’ve messaged her privately rather than “humiliate her publicly“ and that I had upset her holiday. I told her I’m sorry she feels that way but my stance remains the same and she is free to unfriend me. She has since deleted the comments I made.

Should I have messaged her privately? Or ignored completely? AITA here?

You should've messaged her privately. SHE should be more concerned with the record of the place she visited. And her friends should mind their own business.

c25yoo,"Here’s my first post on this sub. So here goes. 

I am having a small get together Friday with friends it’s gonna include drinking and playing games and stuff. In total there is gonna be 8 people but I could fit more of I really wanted to.

Well she texted me earlier today and was like hey can I bring this guy we’ll call him Jerry (not actual name) over or do you guys not like him? 

Honestly our whole friend group does not like this guy. We’re pretty sure he’s racist and he’s like a person you’d see in trashy people subreddits. Like he’ll say the n-word and he’s white and he’ll just use it to refer to people like that and other people racial slurs. He really brings down the whole vibe.

So, I told her I can only fit 8 people in my apartment and that she can’t bring him. (I have only invited 7). I also told her that it was fine by me if he came but that I just don’t have room and she was cool, but I lied to her and she’s a good friend.

ege9jk,"The title roughly sums up what my question is but here’s more background: I’ve just ordered a switch after clearing up some credit card debt(thank you holiday sales) which I’m extremely excited about. I’ve been unable to afford getting one because I see it as a luxury item and most of my money in my paychecks goes towards bills. And here’s where it gets a little messy.

I live with my girlfriend, I have for about 2 years. I mentioned that I bought the switch finally and was really excited because I wanted to play the pokemans and what not. Initially she’s a little pissed because she wanted to buy it 50-50. However waiting for her to have that kind of money that she doesn’t spend on herself FIRST would have taken forever. Later that day she mentions she told her friends “secondguessing bought me a switch!!!” Annnd....that’s when I get buyers regret.

To be clear, I don’t mind sharing the console in the sense of playing games together or when I’m not wanting to use it, but I can’t help but feel upset. My parents bought me a ps4 the first Christmas she moved in with me and I mentioned she could use it since she seemed interested in a lot of the games and that console, in her mind, is hers entirely. I have no place touching that system other than when we watch Netflix or something. Most things we “share” end up the same way, actually and most things it doesn’t really bug me. I’m an older sibling, it comes with the territory to learn that’s usually what happens. But, I just wanted this to be mine and mine alone, because most of the time the things I “splurge” on are maybe a coffee or something like that.

TLDR; AITA for wanting to own the switch I bought and not have my girlfriend decide it’s hers",NTA. Dude this is 100% not about the switch and you know it.,"NTA I don't know if someone else has said this, but you mention being an older sibling, so it comes with the territory to learn that's what usually happens.

coxhyb,"    It’s pretty simple, I ordered an item on eBay, he sent the item and I tracked the package. USPS lost the package but they claim that they delivered it. It isn’t the first time that they have delivered my package to a different address so I’m sure that’s probably what happened. I’ve gone up the chain of command and they basically said “we’ll give the mailman a stern warning to pay more attention” 

     So the guy doesn’t want to give a refund because for all intents and purposes it looks like I got the item and I’m just trying to scam him because the tracking number says it was delivered. But I never got it, so I want to do a charge back on my credit card for the $300 because I don’t have money to throw around like that (it was an item I needed and ended up having to get again because it was time sensitive) but I also feel like a jerk because it wasn’t really his fault.","NAH (except for UPS)- You want your money back for an item you didn’t receive which is understandable. He doesn’t want to refund you because from his end it looks like you’ve received the package, which is also understandable. Although you should definitely fight UPS more on this.

Anyway I wouldnt blame you for asking for a charge back.","NAH, you want your money back, which is understandable,  the seller doesn't want to be out 300 and whatever they were selling.

enmejj,"I'm about to become a single mother by choice. My sperm bank provides a lot of information about the donor. A physical description, medical history, professional background, a list of hobbies/interests, a childhood picture of the donor etc. 

Some donors are open to being contacted when the child is an adult. I wanted to find a donor open to this but I was not able to. I chose my donor because he matched all of the other requirements relating to health and was from the same ethnic background as me. That sounds bad, but I feel a strong connection to my home country even though I no longer live there, and it was important to me that my child be the same ethnicity. No other donors matched ethnic background AND my other requirements. Men of my ethnicity don't commonly donate. This wasn't a decision I took lightly. I considered many profiles. I spent weeks deciding. None of the open donors felt right. I don't feel positive about the closed donation. I'd feel unsatisfied never knowing or being able to have a conversation with a biological half of me but I've talked it through with a therapist and come to accept that my family can be enough for my child. 

I'm taking steps to give my child an idea of the biological half they are missing by making an identity box. I included all of the information I have on the donor in the box and my child will grow up understanding their background and the reasons they don't have a father. 

One of the reasons I made my peace with the closed donation is that the bank promised a letter from the donor to the child. I thought at least a letter could give an older child or teenager some closure if they were curious about their biological Father. I received the letter last week. It really isn't a letter. It's clear that the donor was asked to write something while in the office for medicals or something and wrote on a scrap of paper in a hurry. It's a photocopy of the paper and the note is three lines in total. Without quoting verbatim it says:

""This is the strangest thing I've done but it's cool I get to help someone have kids! Good luck in life. I hope it works out for you."" 

It feels anti-climatic to me so I can only imagine how it will feel to my child. I was talking to a friend about it this weekend and I mentioned that I was thinking of typing up something 'from' the donor that was a little more encouraging or at least a little longer. I wouldn't change the essence of the note but I would expand on it so it didn't feel so half-assed. I feel terrible for my child. I know I'll provide all the love and stability in the world but there will come a time when they will wonder. I'm not sure what to do, but my friend advised me that I'm overly emotional at the moment due to hormones and it wouldn't be fair to fake the note even if my child will never find out. I think she's probably right but I'm tempted to give my child more than they've been offered here. WIBTA?","Nope. Don’t lie. Not about something like that. That letter will be defining. It’s not some small white lie. Gently, YTA.","YWBTA- I understand your reasoning I just don’t think it’s the right thing to do.

eoasy4,"My bestie and I moved in together in 2015, and have been living with his two kids, age 4 and 5, ever since. The kids also live part time with their mother, who... tolerates... my presence. Initially she hated me and felt threatened, which was fair, because the bestie and I ended up dating for three years (about a year after she ended it with him). When we broke up, we talked about one of us moving out, but housing where we live is awfully expensive, so we decided to stay together. So far, it's been working out well. We haven't had any major jealousy issues or fights, and we established healthy boundaries early. Things are going so well that we've even talked about the possibility of us dating again.


But life happens. My BFF got fired from his job last month because the company ""wanted to go a new direction"". He has been looking for work and had a couple interviews with a place not too far from where we live. The only caveat to this job is that he would have to work weekends from 1am until 12pm. This is a problem, because he has custody of his kids Thursday night to Monday morning. Since we lived together, he asked me if I could watch the boys on Saturday and Sunday until he gets home... and I said no.


I have a couple of issues with this. The main one is that I'm just not home enough. In the last 6 weeks, I have been home maybe 2 full weekends. There was also a weekend where I wasn't home Saturday but was Sunday. I feel like I'm living out of a suitcase lately... I haven't even finished unpacking from my last trip, and my next one is right around the corner. And that has been an ongoing trend since September. So I can't make him any promises that I can watch the kids every weekend indefinitely. 


The other issue, and perhaps the most selfish one, is that I just don't want to. I don't want to wake up early on both of my days off, on the rare occasions that I'm home, to watch the kids. It would be different if this were temporary, or if I could watch them for just one day and get to sleep in and enjoy a day off on the other day. If they were paying me to babysit that would also be different. But I'm being signed up as a free babysitter on both of my days off, and I'm not terribly happy about that.


The final thing, which ties into my second issue with this situation, is that the BFF's former job's schedule fluctuated all the time. Our schedule with the kids changed all. the. time. BFF and I used to get into fights about it because I never knew when the kids were coming or going.  So I know their mother is capable of moving things around to accommodate changes in his work. I'm not sure why she is being so resilient against changing the schedule now.


The BFF and I talked a little bit about this and he understood where I was coming from. But the mother of the kids has called me every name under the sun. She thinks I'm an awful person and basically thinks ITA because I have the days off and I'm not being a good friend and supporting the BFF. So... AITA?","NTA 

I think asking you to watch the kids on a regular basis every weekend is going way too far.  I wouldn't ask that of my friends.  It's awesome if they can watch my kid once in a rare while when I need help, but every weekend?","NTA at all. Acting as a free babysitter every weekend night is just a massive imposition.

9w2cyt,"On mobile. Sorry for errors. So my DH and I have been married 6 years, together 8. We've always said we aren't ok with openly going to the bathroom in front of each other.

I say ""Seriously, just wait!"" And he refuses. I leave. He gets mad at me for ""Making this a thing"". Now, here's the kicker, WE HAVE A SECOND BATHROOM. There is no reason for him to go into the bathroom I'm using to pee. When I asked why he did that he said ""I didn't think it was a big deal"". I responded by saying we had always said that wasn't something we did and asked why the fuck he thought it was suddenly ok. He just said ""I was ready"". Um clearly I was not. I know this isn't the worst fucking thing but God Dammit there is another bathroom and he could have at least asked me! Now he's mad at me and saying I'm being mean and overreacting. Maybe I am.

434o5r,"This girl was doing homework at my apartment until pretty late. Apartment mate #1 invited her over, so not my guest, but I know her pretty well and have hung out with her before. She got tired around 1 am and fell asleep on our couch so I brought a blanket out for her and chargers for her phone/laptop. At 6am, apartment mate #2 wakes up to find her leaving our place, stops her and tells her that I can drive her home. He then wakes me up and asks me to drive her home. I do, but I'm pissed about it for a couple of reasons:
1. She could have easily walked home (she lives like a 7-8 minute walk from our place, it was light enough to see outside already, and busses were running already).
2. She's not my guest.
3. I was sleeping and was rudely woken up.
4. Apt mate #2 offered my services before asking if I'd be okay with it.

e2h3sc,"I'm openly gay and I take half of the same classes at uni as this guy David who I have a theory started hanging out with me mostly because he wanted a gay friend. He's an insanely socially awkward albeit an alright guy most of the time, but sometimes he says the dumbest things that can be construed as homophobia rather than ignorance, which it is 90% of the time. He's nice to me and he genuinely tries being a friend so I occasionally invite him to have coffee with my friends between classes.

One of my friends, Diana, is a lesbian and she'd never met David before. We were having coffee, and some of the other people in the group started talking about a professor who said something that might be construed as homophobic but was in fact just plain ignorant. David said weeelllllll, I kiiiind of agreeeee........ and Diana started arguing with him. They went back and forth for a bit until she started getting aggressive and called him stupid, evil and homophobic. At that point, I said hey now, let's just drop it and move on, okay? Then Diana turned to me and said that if I'm defending him (which I never did, I just told them to drop it) then I'm homophobic too.

So I decided to diffuse the situation by saying ""I can't be homophobic, I have a gay friend"" as a joke. Diana then told me I was an asshole, and she left. One of the other friends told me it was insensitive to joke like that since she, as a lesbian, has probably heard that sentence (said in a serious way) throughout her life, and I mean yeah... I have too... and so I said it in a mocking way, to make them laugh and change the topic. She said that maybe Diana didn't get that it was a joke. Ffs I'm gay, so why would I use ""I have a gay friend"" as an actual excuse to be homophobic?","Lesbian chiming in here. I think what you said was actually pretty funny, buuuut not appropriate for the moment and clearly escalated the situation. You should have instead helped David understand why Diana was upset, and how the meaning of \*vague comment\* could be thought of as homophobic and upsetting. Because if your friend is truly ignorant about these issues but kind and willing to learn, you should explain to him why it upsets others. I'm also super curious about what this potentially homophobic comment/topic was.","NTA, you’re fine. She was amped up from the argument, you tried diffusing it with a joke, and she got bent instead.

ei0864,"My business has been doing well lately so I've come across a good amount of money. More money than my family could ever imagine any of us having. I'm a second generation immigrant so my parents come from very modest beginnings. Both my parents worked 7 days a week with multiple jobs and 12+ hour shifts to make ends meet. In the meantime, my grandma (dad's mom) raised me, my sister and my cousins until our teenage years. She has been living with my cousins but plans to move out into a retirement home since she hates to be a burden on anyone. But she is still able and healthy and I know she doesn't want to go if she had an alternative.

So to show my appreciation for all my folks have done for me, I've been spending a lot of my money to buy ""gifts"" for my family. I bought my parents new cell phones, paid for several vacations with them, plan to get them a new car. For my grandma, I wanted to get her the best gift for her golden years - her own place. I bought a small 1 bedroom condo and told her she can live there for however long she wants and I will take care of all the bills. She basically has no money and relies on social security each month.

Of course while my grandma was thrilled and ever so grateful, my mom was not. They have a strained relationship going back before my parents got married. I heard from a relative that my mom accused me of favoring my grandma more than her and spending so much. My parents have built up a decent nest egg from saving over the years and I don't think they need the help as much. So as much as I love helping my folks, I feel like this money has also put a huge strain in my relationships. I love them all equally and know they sacrificed so much to raise me, but there's only so much I can do to be ""fair"" or show my appreciation. Maybe I should have kept my money to myself?

cvkyjz,"For context, my mother is an emotional abuser, a manipulator, and a professional victim. She emotionally abused myself, my brother, and my dad, and did it all so she could be taken care of and get what she wanted in order to feel good about herself. My brother and I got the greatest portion of the abuse, and everyone in my family (my dad, aunt, and mom's mom specifically) seems to have decided that it was too difficult to hold my mom accountable for her behavior, so they pretty much did nothing to stop her. In essence, they allowed her to abuse her family.

I am moving back to my hometown in a few days, and my parents are getting a divorce. My dad has finally had enough of my mom's behavior, and is leaving her for another woman. I understand his reasoning quite well, but the way he is going about it is not appropriate. My grandmother (mom's mom) decided to message me and tell me that, when I get home, I shouldn't be ""mean"" to my mom, and to not put her at fault for the divorce, because my dad is the one that is leaving her and he should have acted to prevent my mom's bad behavior. 

Apparently, in my family, holding people accountable for their abusive behavior and defending oneself from said behavior is considered being ""mean"". I told my grandmother that I refuse to not hold my mother accountable, and that if she wants to point fingers at my dad for his cowardice (both for leaving my mother and for not stopping her behavior), then she needs to recognize that everyone who saw my mom's abusive behavior but did nothing (like her) are complicit in my mother abusing her children. I explained that while my dad's actions are shitty, he is a victim of her abuse too, so I don't blame him for wanting to leave her although I DO hold him accountable for the way he's doing it, and for his part in not stopping her in the first place.

At some point I made it clear that if anyone wants to point fingers at my dad, then they need to recognize that they were just as cowardly as he was, because they saw her abuse and did nothing. She insisted that they weren't cowardly, to which I responded ""Well, if you all saw what she was doing, and did nothing, then what DOES that make you?"".

She didn't like that, and flipped out on me. Honestly, I don't feel bad. This whole situation is filled with people blaming others for their behavior, but being unable to recognize how they played a part. Me calling my family out for their hypocrisy and cowardice feels right, but I wonder if I'm being too hard on them. After all, I know that my mom can lash out and throw fits when she is criticized, so I understand why they didn't intervene. At the same time... they pretty much stood out of the way while my mother traumatized myself and my brother, so fuck it. But, let's hear from you. AITA?",NTA.

She has her own little apartment. She then moved out to take a job opportunity somewhere. My mom abruptly came home one day and asked me about the abuse and pretty much went and filed for divorce that day. Years later I found out my Aunt heard me being abused. She could hear me being beat. She called my mom and told her after she moved out. My aunt listened to me being beaten for a few years and didn't say shit.

ci5xal,"Obligatory, this is a throwaway because I'm paranoid. 

So my brother (m28) and I (m24) live together and his fiance (f26) lives in a city a couple hours away. They alternate weekends to go see each other. Every weekend his fiance is in town, she has an annoying habit of parking in my spot in the garage. 

We have a two-car garage. I feel having a garage to park in is a luxury compared to having to park your car outside. It's more convenient and a lot safer as well. I also feel it is common sense that if you are paying to live somewhere, the right to park in the garage is afforded to you. My brother and I pay. It's a two-car garage. One spot for him, the other for me. Simple, right? Well, my brothers fiance does not seem to get that.

I didn't talk to my brother about it because he's super defensive of his fiance because of her past with severe social anxiety and trouble making and keeping friends. Every time she is rude, he just argues that she does not know any better. We already got in a huge argument when I addressed her cringey PDA that she does in front of me, my parents, and her parents so I wasn't trying to stir more shit up. Until last weekend, when I just snapped.

I come home Saturday morning to find her in my spot again. Knowing I was going to leave town and my friend was driving, I parked in the middle of the driveway and blocked both of their cars from being able to pull out of the garage. I left town about 30 minutes later and a couple hours later my brother calls me, pissed, saying neither of them could pull out and why I parked that way. I played dumb honestly and said I just parked quickly and left. I took the opportunity to suggest that he park in the driveway from now on, let his fiance park in his spot, and let me park in mine. It seemed like a reasonable agreement to ensure I get my spot, and that both my brother and his fiances car can pull out if needed. When I mentioned that, he immediately hung up. Luckily, my parents were able to find my spare key and they were able to move my car.

It's been a week now and we still have not talked about it. We still talk normally just haven't mentioned that particular situation. His fiance came in to town today and she was parked in his spot, my brother was parked in the driveway, ultimately freeing my spot.
 
AITA?? It seems I got my point across because they took my suggestion but I still feel like an asshole for a few reasons. 

* I didn't talk to him about it first.
* I get the garage and the whole house to myself pretty much every other weekend so should I even be that bent about it? 
* There isn't actually any contract that states I get the garage spot with what I pay. We're brothers and we just go by trust. I just think it's common sense. 

I doubt she meant harm by any of it but I feel like it should be common sense. Let me know, Reddit. 

Thanks.","YTA- this is an extremely inmature response to the situation. You need to talk to your brother and his finace about the living arrangement and who parks where.

You should've asked her to stop parking in your spot the second time she did it. She should've had more common sense. Your brother should've also thought ""hey maybe I should park on the street"".

do4p9o,"My gf finished an intense grad program in May. For two years, her closest friends were in her cohort and were a mixed gender group with three women (including her) and four men. When the program finished, the two other women and one man accepted jobs in other states and moved away, leaving a friend group that is my GF and three guys who we will call Matthew, Mark, and Luke.

Since her friends moved, she still hangs out with those three regularly just as she hung out with the group before, and they have a group text and are all pretty close. Still she's been trying to find new girlfriends to hang out with and recently met a woman named Sarah who comes with a husband named Isaac.

The problem started when she tried to integrate the groups. The guys liked Sarah fine but none of them liked Isaac because they thought he was 'a bro' or 'a douche.' My gf was stressing about it because she really wanted Sarah to be part of her 'group.' I've met Isaac and I think he's fine, so I explained to my gf what's really going on: chances are, Matthew, Mark, and Luke want to sleep with her (my gf) and they don't want another guy around competing.

My gf's feelings were really hurt and she insisted that all three of them were just friends and that nothing has changed, and that none of them have ever been inappropriate with her and hit on her. She doesn't love Isaac either but she doesn't dislike him like they do but says she can see why they don't like him. Still, this is basically how guys work. We don't really have girl 'friends,' especially not super pretty girls. They most likely either have crushes or at least would sleep with her if she asked.

bj3npg,"I've been living with my brother and his wife for a year. When my husband left me, they offered to have me and my kids move in with them in a different state so I could start over and get back on my feet. They work full time and have a baby. I have 2 kids kindergarten aged. I currently don't work since I have to take care of the kids alone and one of them isn't in school yet. I try to keep the house clean. I know my standards are pretty high, I got very good at keeping my own house clean and organized and was proud of it. They're quite a bit messier than I am, and will leave trash out, have dirty dishes in their room which they bring out to the kitchen all crusty, leave pots and pans out with food stuck to it, not wipe up messes from cooking, and leave all kinds of just little random stuff lying around. Plus their dogs drag trash around and pee on my things.

I understand that i am responsible for more cleaning than they would be, since they work full time. I don't mind at all and I do usually enjoy keeping the place clean. But I don't think I should have to clean up every little thing they leave. But if I don't clean up their stuff I have to just live with trash and dirty dishes building up on the counter, trash and random stuff laying on the floor or on the couch or on tables, old food containers in the fridge, etc. It's overwhelming, and not only do I get more anxious and depressed living in a mess, I don't want my kids to get used to living in such a messy environment.

I have brought up my concerns a few times but nothing changes. They avoid conflict and awkward interactions so it's hard to sit down with them and have a serious discussion (plus they don't spend much time in the common areas).

I've even left dishes and trash to pile up while I was either sick or in a really bad place mentally and it will last for a week or more. I asked if they could go through a box of random stuff I didn't know where to put while I was cleaning. I just dont know what is really appropriate as far as how much I should confront them.

cabo6v," 

My wife is at our vacation home upstate for the week, partially for work. She has a pretty strict curfew for our son, he has to be home at 10pm. He's 17 years old as of 3 weeks ago.

Last night, at around 9:20, he asked if he could go to a friends backyard party. It was 10 blocks away. Even though he would never admit it to me, I know his friends at least drink alcohol sometimes, I've heard them talk about it before while they thought I wasn't listening. I assumed he would be drinking there possibly, or at least, I knew there was a chance he would. I decided to let him go and told him he has to be home anytime from midnight to 1am, and that he cant get drunk or I will know. I feel in retrospect like this was a huge betrayal of my wifes wishes. She doesn't even allow him to stay out past 10, now I was telling him he could stay out until 1am technically? Even if it is only 10 blocks away, its still a party. I drove him there, partially because I wanted to see what it was. I could see their backyard, it just looked like maybe 30-40 teens hanging out with music playing. I didn't see any dancing or anything too crazy.... He did nothing wrong. He came home at around 12:15, he didn't smell anything like alcohol, and he went to bed. Its possible he drank a beer or two and I couldn't smell it, but I don't mind as long as he wasn't drunk. We let him have wine at dinner and sometimes beer at family events. The next day, she called and we talked, and she asked what our son was doing and I lied and said he did nothing yesterday. I don't often lie to my wife, really at all, so this was really weird to me.

I feel bad for lying to my wife, but I also know that she is overprotective over him by a lot. Even when he was younger she didn't let him walk to his junior high school despite it being only 15 blocks away. I just feel sort of like there is no point in telling her because its such a minor thing that she would freak out over, its basically just not worth it at all. I am also worried that she would go even harder being overprotective over him.

Was I wrong? Should I have consulted my wife? Should I have asked her first if this was okay? I just feel like I know she would have said no and possibly gotten a bit upset that I would even ask.

cs0awa,"So my girlfriend and I moved into a new home last year. They way our neighborhood is set up we are pretty much surrounded by 6 or 7 other houses in this little subdivision. When we moved in we noticed one neighbor has an older hound that just runs around the subdivision and has no collar or tags. We live in TN so this is not out of the ordinary but this dog instantly started getting on my nerves. She comes in my yard and aggressively barks at me when doing yard work. She's not aggressive and runs if you approach her but still harasses us and poops all in the yard. Now the kicker for me and my tipping point is she has been up in the neighbors yard barking 2 to 3 nights a week keeping us up. I had to go out at 3am this morning to try to run her off to try to get some sleep. Now for the caveat, I spoke to the neighbor a few weeks ago and he said its not even their dog. He says she is a stray that they started leaving food out for about 10 years ago and she has now just stuck around long enough and made herself a part of the neighborhood. The dog has obviously had multiple litters of pups which tells me shes never been fixed and no vet care is being provided for her. So would I be the asshole for calling animal control to come get this dog that doesn't legally belong to anyone and who barks and keeps me up all night but has been the neighborhood dog for 10 years?",NTA if no one is taking responsibility for it,"Nta- is what I’m going to go with. No one actually owns her and it’s annoying as hell when dog barking keeps you up. Just remember that your neighbours will know it’s you and probably hate you for it. Or love you for it.

as55x5,"Last February my ex assaulted me at work, he'd been previously verbally abusive but he crossed a line when he pushed me around our work's office and cornered me multiple times to yell at me while I was trying to close the store all because I wouldn't let him in while I was counting cash.

Our friends are mutual friends, they've all seen the security footage from that night, heard the stories, held me when I cried even. Since then my mental health has been in turmoil which has definitely caused a lot of problems in our group. My recent meltdown had me sent to a behavioral health center and I dropped contact with all my friends for a couple months. 

I deeply want to apologize for dropping off the face of the earth and hurting them the way I have by causing problems that weren't even there in the first place. They're under no obligation to accept my apology but it eats me alive that they still hang out with my abusive ex but they've all blocked me off.

 Am I the asshole for feeling some type of way about this?","NTA, feel free to cut contact with these jerks and make some friends who will take your feelings into account and don't feel comfortable around violent people.","NTA.

If he’d assaulted me and I’d found out that any one of my friends even so much as smiled at him I’d go off on one.

cklg7d,"So we're sitting at breakfast while on a vacation and the topic of dogs came up. A couple days ago I learned on reddit that that onions among other things are poisonous for dogs. 

I wanted to talk about that earlier and this conversation reminded me, so I just blurted out ""hey mom do you give your dogs onions?"" And she says not on their own but probably when she gives the dog the leftovers of the day, so probably also garlic and whatever else. I try to explain how I think that is a really bad thing to do, and the table sort of unanimously sides against me with arguments like ""oh we feed our dogs leftovers with onions and garlic all the time and they look healthy so it can't be that bad"" or ""back in my day our dogs didn't eat anything but leftovers"" or ""my dog eats chocolate and he's still alive"". 

I get annoyed and try to push my point of view, saying that people thought smoking was healthy too back in their day, but almost everyone at the table smokes besides my sister, so it's also swept under the rug. I originally wanted to bring up cancer as well but my grandfather who's also at the table is currently in remission so I left that part out. 

I actually start getting pissed now because in my eyes they are all slowly killing their dogs and are happy about it too, but according to the rest of the table I'm the asshole for ruining breakfast and the general atmosphere of the day as early as breakfast. 

I was aggressive in my tone in the end, I kept repeating that my mom was actively killing her dog and that she should feel sorry for the poor thing. I didn't yell, but pushed on hard enough that in the end everyone was angry at me and left the table. This is a fuck up on my part. I know that especially my mom doesn't respond well to this, and it's very easy to actually completely ruin her day because she will twist it into an ""everyone is against me or hates me"" narrative. This sounds like a guilt trip, but I'm pretty sure that's how she actually experiences it. 

I feel kind of bad right now, but should I feel bad because I believe my family is poisoning their dogs or because I'm an asshole who ruined the vacation by pushing something they didn't want to talk about? Maybe a vacation wasn't the best time to bring this up.","YTA. It's great to be concerned and give helpful info, but you said you pushed your pov. That's rarely a good move without a lot more info.

bp7gt7,"So I am hanging at home tonight with my fiance (apartment building with 4 units) and the door buzzer goes off at 9PM. We are not expecting anyone and this happens all the time - sometimes as late as 10. Probably at least 50 times in the 4 months we've been here. We usually just ignore it. 

We had thought previously there might be an issue with the buzzer system or maybe that people were just buzzing all the apartments to get in....who knows. So this time my fiance gets pissed and says through the speaker to whoever it is to stop. They keep buzzing for about another 10 seconds so I go out to the door and it is my neighbor across the hall. We have said hello to each other before but that is that. 

She says (super bitchy-like) ""yeah, hi I'm not buzzing to be a bitch, I need to get in"" - I say whatever and apologize for my fiance not buzzing her in but say ""this happens all the time and we weren't expecting anyone"". 

She starts in that her boyfriend wasn't responding to her buzzer or her calls and that they only had one key. From time to time she needs to buzz our door so she can get in. I clarify that she has been doing this for a while, she confirms.

I say ""a heads up or clarification that you would be doing this would have been nice"" and she responds ""I DONT HAVE YOUR NUMBER DUDE.""...lol - they have had plenty of time to exchange info if they needed a favor!!

Again I tell her we weren't expecting someone and it's a little late to just get a random buzz. She responds with ""ITS ONLY 9PM!""

At this point I'm pissed and have so many things to say but instead I just shake my head and go for the door. 

She says ""WHATEVER DUDE"" and I head in.

es5bp1,"Using a throwaway because my wife knows my public.

First off, I love my wife. We’ve been married for a little over 18 months now and things couldn’t be better. However, she just left the house to go stay with her sister over a conversation and she says I’m in the wrong. So, into the story.

My wife loves mashed potato with butter. I work nights,  so she makes dinner for herself most of the time. Every night that she cooks for herself she’ll have a whole potato with whatever protein and greens, usually zucchini. 

She isn’t overweight or obese, but before we met she was. She loves her body now and of course I do to. But I’m really worried that this is could cause her to slip back on all the great work she’s done, and frankly I don’t know if a whole potato a day is good for her health. We both have today off (I have tonight off work) so I tried to bring this up with her gently, and suggested maybe taking a week off the potato and seeing how she feels. I also said I could bulk cook some meals on the weekend for her so she wouldn’t have to fall back on starchy white potatoes.

She was really upset and kept asking me if I was saying she was getting fat - I told her that I loved her and was just worried for her health in the future. We didn’t really fight about it, but she decided to stay at her sisters tonight, which means I won’t see her until after I finish my shift tomorrow night at the least. 

Should I have just kept my mouth shut?

EDIT: I get it. I suck. I’ll apologise when she comes home. Cheers.","YTA.  You admit you have no idea if a whole potato a day is good for her health, but you feel free to guess that it isn't and to criticize her for it out of fear she'll get fat?  Wow.  Since a whole potato is about 100 calories and if you've cooked them previously and cooled them overnight is also a resistant starch, it's not such an awful thing, not a whole lot different than an apple.  But even if there were more to the story and she was eating a 3 pound monster potato or coating it with fattening things, that's really her choice to make.  So you're coming across as an ignorant, controlling jerk.","I mean... NTA but it's just a potato?

e6wzl9,"I'm not proud of this.

I'm a mother to 2 children, a boy, age 6 and a girl, age 8.

My parents haven't had the best relationship. I was unplanned when they were 17, they had been dating a year but only got married out of obligation, they've never hidden this from me and have spent the majority of their marriage arguing. They keep separating and living apart for a while until dad moves back in, then they'll argue until they separate again. They've been doing this pretty constantly with little variation since I was about 10 and still do it to this day, and I'm now 32. They openly told me as a child that they were only together because of me, they nearly divorced when I was around 22, and then I got pregnant with my daughter and they agreed to stay together for *my* kids. They only became more committed to that when my ex husband and I divorced about 4 years ago.

They babysat the kids for me last weekend, which was the first time they've ever had them for the weekend. I asked them because they've been ""back together"" for 8 months now and it had been a while since either of them had called me to complain about the other, so I figured things had calmed down a bit for them.

The kids told me when I went to pick them up that it wasn't a very fun weekend because, according to my daughter, ""nanny and granddad were fighting the whole time"". My parents offered me a cup of tea so I sent the kids off to play while we talked.

In the following conversation I said that I'd spoken to the kids and they'd told me what had happened. My parents tried to play it off as no big deal but I told them, essentially, that their arguing had affected me for my whole life, and I don't want that for my kids. I said they never needed to stay married for my sake, and if they stay married for the sake of my children then that won't end well. I told them ""I won't come see you or let you see my kids if you're arguing, and you only argue when you're together, so either end this or we're out.""

My parents replied that I'm not being fair, I can't make them get a divorce, or give them this big an ultimatum, but I don't want my kids around this, so either they need to remove themselves from the situation or I'll remove myself and my children.

My parents have sent me a joint text message (signed from both of them) saying again that I'm being unfair, they love me, they love my children and they don't want to lose touch. I've said again that me and my children will not be visiting until the situation is resolved. They asked if they could come to me. I said they had to come separately. They replied that they've been together for 32 years, it's not as simple as just getting divorced, and I can't give them an ultimatum like this. I have asked them numerous times to see a counselor or get couples therapy and they refuse because they feel they ""might as well just burn the money"".

AITA?

Info: I have asked them recently to see a marriage counselor, and I have asked them to do this at least once a year since I was a teenager. They have always refused. Me outright telling them they need to divorce is my last resort, and I'm not happy about it.","ESH. It's not your place to demand they divorce, but it's 100% your place to refuse to subject your children to it.

You can tell them they can not be together in front of your kids, and allow them separate access to you and your kids, and stay married, but not visit together.

&amp;#x200B;

Belle is in her 5th year of College as a civil engineering major.  I've (Optim) raised Belle 100% on my own.  Her Mom is no-contact, and moved back to her home country when Belle was 3.

To me those remarks are mildly infuriating since nothing is stopping them from buying a m&amp;k combo to play those games as well but for whatever dumb reason they don't do it.

A couple weeks ago i found out that the family and I are going on vacation for the 1st 5 days of June and that everyone of my family members got their time off. However when i tried to get off I was denied, and my managers said too many people requested it off before me. 

I talked to them to see if they could reconsider, unfortunately they wouldnt budge and told me that I'd have to go another time. So i tell my family this and they say thats its virtually impossible for them to reschedule, especially my mom since her job almost never approves her day off requests.

etxnur,"Starting in the middle of it, I was kicked and blocked from a group chat I've been in for 6 months after saying to someone that ""you're lucky to have friends"" when he complains about feeling lonely due to his conditions with cancer. He explains that his hospital visits over a span of a year restrict him from communicating to his friends, including everyone in this group chat, as well as insult to injury he has a history of bad relationships with his family members. However, even in the group chat, he barely told anyone that he had cancer, yet alone that he feels lonely, and kept to only 3-4 people.

I've only heard that he got cancer after someone who knew about it brought it up, before quickly deleting the message, and I didn't take much note of it (after all it's clear that they don't want anyone else to read it). His condition and how lonely he felt or how it's acting up were all kept secret from me. Instead, he posts pictures of the hospital whilst saying all over in the group chat about how the nurses know his name due to how frequent his hospital visits were and how kind they were. This often sparked more conversations than me talking to anyone in the chat, and the more he kept even mentioning it the more I get irritated that I think that he's doing all of this for attention, with the perfect excuse that he has this 'condition'.

The group chat was open to talking about personal problems. It felt extremely comforting to have a place to talk about problems I was going through, including theirs which I still respectfully listen to, and the members invited me to share them. As a result I was given privileges to be in their 'inner circle'. But even in their circle, they barely talk about the person's cancer or his condition, and if they do they describe his 'condition' so vaguely that I was confused on what his 'condition' was. In addition, the treatment to him sharing his problems (most likely because he has cancer) was more attentive and compassionate than problems I had with loneliness and fear of missing out within the group itself. That irritated me.

So then he complains about how lonely it feels going to hospital and all that stuff. I snapped. ""At least you're lucky to have friends that care about you"". 100 messages about how much of an insensitive asshole I am, and kicked. For two months I felt extremely depressed, but of course I can't apologise or say anything. Blocked on this, ignored messages, all that. The rest of this single conversation spread all over the group chat, and the blocking and silence continued.

To this day, I would've still felt guilty about this, but the more I think of it, it pisses me off. They call me an insensitive asshole for not understanding and being sympathetic to the state and effect of his condition, when he kept it secret from many people, including me being in their 'inner circle', and only dropped hints about how great or terrible he felt being in hospital.

I'm not using a throwaway since I don't expect this to exactly incriminate me. 

I love wine. I love most types of alcohol, which is why I work as a bartender, but I especially love wine. A few months ago, I met a bunch of new people at a wine tasting for people ""in the business"" (for lack of better phrasing), joining them on a few after-works and becoming fast friends. I am significantly younger than most of them, by 7 or 8 years at least, but I really do enjoy hanging out with them. 

One of them, a guy I'll call Brendan, turned 29 a few days ago. I wasn't able to attend his actual celebration, but we made plans to have dinner at his place, have a few drinks, watch tv, and hang out with his beautiful, good good dog. 

I had a fairly expensive bottle of wine from my modestly sized collection: A Grace Family Cabernet Sauvignon, from 2013. These go for about 300-400 dollars, and there are only 600-700 cases made every year. There's also a waiting list, which is why I normally would never have gotten my hands on one: My brother in laws grandfather let me buy one from him at a discount as a graduation present when I was 18.

I figured that drinking wine is best to do with wine lovers, and brought it to cork open after dinner, and we finished it between us over episodes of WILTY. It tasted pretty fantastic.

I left at about 1 am, thinking that I had had a wonderful evening.

The next day, I got a text from Brendan, saying that whilst he appreciated the wine and enjoyed it, he thought that it was incredibly rude of me to drink from a bottle I gave to someone else, and that a gift wasn't meant to be shared with the giver. He said it was disingenuous of me, and that I was really just giving it to myself. 

I was taken aback by this, and have been kind of agonising over it these last few days, especially since we don't know each other very well and I really want them to like me.

Anyway I have very limited funds, that’s what I’m getting at. For a white girl I’m unfortunately very prone to long thick ingrown hairs on my legs. It’s disgusting, itchy, they look like thick black lines under my pale white skin and it creeps me out and I compulsively itch and dig at my skin until I get them out. 

In order to try minimize damage I purchased a pair for of tweezerman ingrown hair tweezers which cost me a LOT of money. I know the $ is nothing to some people but it was expensive for me. I keep them in their special pouch in my makeup bag and I take that makeup bag with me when I visit my dad and stepmom. 

Now my stepmom, I really dislike her. She isnt rude per se but I definitely don’t feel welcome when she’s around and she treats me waaaayyy differently to her kids with my dad. I don’t have a relationship with her but because my whole family are very strongly religious I have to go to be a good Christian blah blah.

Anyway when I was eating some cereal downstairs she snuck into my room and took my tweezers and used them to pluck an ingrown hair that was covered in pus from her private area. She then replaced them. When she came down she said she ‘borrowed them’ for that purpose in front of my dad. 

I was so angry but I know better to yell so I asked her to clarify. She said she had worn tight panties the week before and she needed to borrow my tweezers and said I might wanna wash them. I told her she had no right to touch my stuff and my dad interrupted and said ‘everything in this house is ours unless I tell you otherwise’. 

I’m pretty emotional I can’t lie so I did cry, which I’m annoyed about, and I told my dad she could keep the nasty ass tweezers, I didn’t want them back. I also called her a thieving loser because I just couldn’t believe someone went into my makeup bag. I went back to my moms and she promised to buy me a new pair, but she also wants me to apologize to my dad and stepmom for disrespecting them in their house.","NTA. You disrespected them? Nah. They went through your stuff, and then your dad has the audacity to say 'everything in the house is ours unless I say so' when you paid your own money for this. What a tyrant. No wonder you want out",INFO Why do you think YTA?,0,0
ciakr2,"Long time lurker, first time actually creating an account and posting because I am having a really hard time seeing the other side of this situation. I need to know, AITA??

SO here we go.. we (husband and I) have been paying my husband's little (step) sister (we will call her Trish) to watch my son a few days a week for several months on an as needed basis. The as needed is important. 

The agreement was that we would pay her 20 quid a day, regardless of how long she is there (2 hours-5 hours max) and regardless of how many days a week.  I message her at the beginning of each week and let her know when I need her, what times, etc. 

My mother in law (not her mother) was recently injured and offered to watch my son while she is off work. I accepted, A. Because it's free, B. Because she does a much better job with my son.  I work from home, and there are times when I have to intervene with Trish because she cant settle him, won't change a nappy, cant make his bottles, etc. We basically pay her to hang out at our house and make sure he doesn't hurt himself. Not saying it isn't helpful, but you get the idea.

So mother in law breaks her ankle, I message Trish to tell her that I wouldn't need her for the next few weeks because my mother in law has injured herself and cant work. Her response was ok that's fine. An hour later my husband's dad calls and reems him out saying that we are being unfair to Trish, that she feels used and like we just threw her to the curb AND THE KICKER.... that she was really depending on that money to go to a festival.  And that he (husband's dad) and his wife (Trish's mom) are very upset with us.

Other small details: she is on holiday right now has been posting bags from Gucci, Holister, etc. We went shopping the other week and she spent 200 on clothes. My mom was staying with us visiting for two weeks and it wasn't a problem when I didn't need her to watch him then. There have also been many days/weeks when I dont need her, and it's never been a problem. 

TLDR; AITA for not paying my husband's step sister to half ass watch my son because she needs the money, when I can get better childcare for free?",[deleted],"NTA, babysitting is not a job that comes with guaranteed hours. If she needs money, there are plenty of jobs that do have more hours, and while £20 is a great amount for 2-3 hours of babysitting at 18, if she'd do two shifts at a shop each week she'd end up with more money for the same amount of hours, though probably a little more effort too.",0,0
aea4u9,"First, my apologies as this is my first post on Reddit, although I've been a big fan/lurker for a while now.

Second, some context: My husband and I have been together for 10 years now, and married officially for 2 months. We have a daughter who is 4 years old.

I recently (Beginning of December 2018) started working at a company that is about 30 mins away. We are a one car family, and my shift is mon-fri, 7am-3:30 pm. Our daughter attends pre-k, and normally I have to drop her off in before care hours. (6am) when school starts at 8:30 am, because of my schedule. My husband works a 1pm to 10pm shift wed-sun. 

This morning we got in to a tiff because I was having difficulty with our daughter waking up. Not only was I trying to get ready, but trying to help our daughter aswell. When I woke him up to ask if he could help get her dressed while I made her breakfast, he immediately got defensive about how I'm always asking him to get up way earlier than he ""needs"" to be, about how I KNOW how hard it is for him to go back to sleep once he's awake. It ended up with me huffing and puffing and telling him to just go back to bed. I was late to work, again, because of this encounter and traffic. 

Hours later now that I've cooled down, I wonder if I'm expecting too much of him and being as inconsiderate as he thinks. 

Edit: Some questions I've gotten are regarding the schedule and parental splitting, so I want to share our schedule to give some better perspective. 

Mondays- He is off work, unless there is something that needs done (Major chores, errands etc) husband wakes anywhere between 8am to 12pm. Daughter and I are up at 5am to get dressed, eat breakfast, go to school/work. I pick daughter up around 4, once I get out of work, then prepare dinner/bathe daughter/help with homework and do anything that needs doing inbetween (dishes, laundry, sweeping, etc.) Daughter and I are usually in bed at 8-9pm. 

Tuesday - Same as Monday.

Wednesday - Same as Monday, with the exception that husband wakes around 11-12 to get ready/ catch a bus to work, until 10pm. Daughter and I pick him up with car at 10, daughter is asleep in car because her bed time doesn't change from 8. (She sleeps like a rock, thankfully, so moving her from bed, to car, back to bed does not disturb her) 

Thursday - Same as Wednesday.

Friday - Same as Wednesday.

Saturday - Daughter and I wake up around 8am (no school, no work) and do our day. I make breakfast, do house/garden chores if needed, we go play at the park, etc. Husband takes the car to work to be there by 1pm (Leaves around 12:30, he wakes up usually around 10-11pm) and is home by 10:15-10:30 (His shift ends at 10.) Usually daughter and I are asleep/in bed by this time.

Sunday - Same as Saturday.","I think it's unreasonable to expect him to wake up during the middle of his ""night"" to spend 30 minutes getting your daughter ready for school while you're already up. So for this particular morning, YTA.

HOWEVER, overall, NTA. Your husband should swap his sleeping schedule so that he goes to bed immediately after coming home from work, and then wakes up around 7. Then he can get your daughter ready, you don't need to pay for before-school care, and he's in no risk of being late to work because of it.

This is something you need to discuss beforehand: you can't just shift your sleep schedule by 6 hours all of a sudden. But it sounds like it would be a better schedule for all of you.","# [Vote here for your favorite posts and comments of 2018!](https://redd.it/adh2vn)

ebv5n3,"tl;dr: My brother, a lawyer who lives in an international Asian city, won’t stop wearing kilts on a casual basis. Our family hates it. We are not scottish. 

About 2-3 years ago he and his wife got hooked on Outlander; a TV show set in the Middle Ages in Scotland. They thought it would be funny to order kilts and wear them, but my brother took a liking to his, bought more and has been wearing them almost anytime he’s not at work. What this means is that in every picture we see of him and his family, he’s wearing this (IMO) ridiculous kilt in a sad attempt to be edgy and ‘zany’. Just FYI, he doesn’t look good in it.  He looks like a person with mental problems. 

He gets stared at all over town where he lives, and my own friends think it’s bizarre. I’m concerned it’s going to affect his life professionally (his coworkers/bosses would probably not approve if they saw him in these outfits) and it will affect the lives of his children (who are 1-5 years old) who will be in the ‘eccentric’ family. 

I’ve checked with some close friends in the city I live in, they think it’s a stupid and possibly career-dangerous idea.

I wish I could post some pics with his face blurred out (and with his consent), not sure what the rules are in this sub.

Edit: so, I think it’s pretty clear what the result is, I’m happy to accept it. Thanks everyone for your inputs. Our other brother has suggested that I have to wear one of his kilts for a day because I lost our bet. To be clear, we’re all currently in a SE Asian country so guess I get to find out what it’s like to be stared at all day ;)

Edit 2: yup, looks like I’m wearing a kilt for a day, lol","YTA

b5t4o9,"Background: I'm part of a decently-sized friend group made up of an about equal number of girls and guys (including myself 5F 4M). I recently (a month and a half ago) started dating this guy and he's been a great bf. He's friends with the guys in our group so two weeks after I started dating him I invited him to come along to an event. My friends all seemed to enjoy having him there so whenever we go do something together, I invite him. Over the past week and a half I've noticed my friends are flirting a LOT with him and he's is apparently enjoying it and doing nothing to stop them. Yesterday we went to a restaurant and the flirting would just not stop and he barely talked to me. After we ate I asked him if we could speak privately. We went outside and I told him I didn't like the way he was encouraging the flirting and told him I didn't want him to come to any more events for the time being. He told me that it wasn't him doing the majority of the flirting and that he was very sorry for barely talking to me but that it was unfair for him to be held to a double standard because the guys in my friend group flirt with me a lot too. I told him that we've been friends for years and that it's not the same as him flirting with people he recently met. After this I told my friends that I didn't like how much he'd been flirting with them so he wouldn't be coming to anymore events and all of them (including the guys) started telling me that I'm an asshole. 

So, AITA for no longer inviting my BF to events?","YTA - if you're going to flirt with people in front of him and he's not allowed to thats really unfair. It doesn't matter if they are your friends for years, it still probably makes him uncomfortable. Either you both stop, or neither stop.","ESH.
Your friends shouldn't be flirting with your boyfriend and your boyfriend shouldn't be encouraging it.  But flirting is flirting and with your boyfriend being new how is he supposed to just know your flirting is different than his flirting? And once again flirting is flirting even if you have known someone for years so YTA for saying he can't flirt but you can.  If the roles were reversed would you be cool with him flirting with women friend he has known for years?  Also does your friend group just get together to flirt with each other?

b0w98d,"She’s been having debilitating back and stomach pains. It’s to the point where she regularly sobs and complains constantly about it. She’s taken every over the counter painkiller and it does fuck all for her. Then one night she started balling uncontrollably and said it hurt her every time she exhaled, so I suggested a doctors appointment for the next morning but she refused, got offended even. As the night progresses it gets worse and I’m on the verge of picking her up and throwing her in the car to take her to a hospital so I tell her that I want her to see help and she just cusses me out and says I’m being a jerk for not respecting her wishes as she wanted to wait two weeks until she had a break from school. But I told her I was worried at the possibility of her drifting off and stop breathing entirely in her sleep, to which she said she’d be fine and she had important things in class the next morning anyway. But I was adamant about taking her and in the end she just tossed me out in anger and has not spoken to me since despite my attempts to speak to her. It’s been 3 days. So AITA?

80e7pn,"Back in august of 2017 I was living with my dad, he is in his in his 60's and I am 18. Well, one day my dad was at the kitchen table drinking coffee with his friends, when he saw my cat messing around with one of his plants. He called me into the room to make me make the cat stop, so I picked him up and took him to my room. Well, a few hours later, i'm getting ready for work and the cat does it again so my dad yells at me and tells me ""get that thing under control or i'll take it outside and shoot the fucking thing."" I put the cat back into my room, closed the door and told my dad ""Fuck off you psycho"" and went to work. I come home after work and my birth certificate, Social Security Card and other paperwork are on my computer desk. He comes into my room and says ""i'm fucking off. get out of my house."" and goes outside and takes the license plates off my car (which is my only way to work, i was a pizza delivery boy. But he also bought them and paid the insurance, so he had the right to do it i guess) and tells me to leave. I pack up some things and i lived with my girlfriend for a few months before working at mcdonalds for a while and getting enough to have an apartment.

cwr4za,"So, I never thought I’d have to post here tbh.  I usually have casual/good interactions with strangers so this is strange to me.  Me=Me, PA=Pool Attendant 

I have a routine at least 5 days/week that goes like this;

1) Wake up

2) Put on gym clothes

3) Pack a backpack with a change of clothes, water/pre-workout, headphones, chargers, and some sort of snack (trailmix)

4) Work out, while listening to music

5) Shower/change clothes/repack backpack accordingly

6) Get a coffee and Go on about my day freshly showered and feeling refreshed 


Something that might be important is that all of this happens within the same resort building that the (very) small town I live in is built around.  

The gym is part of the “fitness center” that also includes a pool, hot tub, and sauna.  The showers I use are part of the locker room, this area is tended to by 1-2 attendants at a time, who clean the facility as well as replacing towels etc.  


Now to the story.  I was between steps 4 &amp; 5 in my routine, I had taken off my gym clothes, and was in the process of getting my clean outfit all set up.  While I putting my dirty clothes in the backpack, as well as drinking some water/eating some nuts etc. I saw a woman behind me in the mirror.  It was the PA.

I was wearing underwear, socks, and headphones.  The only way I can describe her face is “in disbelief”, and this is when I noticed her mouth was moving.  As I took out my headphone this is what I heard;

PA: “-y I asked!”

Me: “What?” (Removing headphone)

PA: *disapproving/offended squint* “This is why I asked if there was someone in here,” *gesturing at me*

Me: *Genuinely pretty confused* “I had my headphones in?”

PA:  “Yeah, so that’s the problem here.” *rolls eyes and starts to walk away*

-This is where I realized she was giving me an attitude, rather than this being a misunderstanding.

Me: “Yeah, okay.”

PA walking out the door: “I literally asked but it’s fine” (sarcasm)

That was the end of it.  I was pretty beside myself, and immediately started to think about how it could have played out differently.

Here’s my two main issues; 

1) If you have some personal issue with potentially seeing a semi-dressed young man, then you might not want to accept a job where you will almost certainly see that, by working in the designated “half-naked-man-room”

2) What if this were some older man who had just left the pool and, oh I don’t know, wasn’t wearing their hearing-aid?  Is that an appropriate reaction to someone who didn’t hear you for some other reason?

If the issue she has is the fact that my headphones are what made me not hear her, then it’s a personal issue.  I thoroughly read every separate rules placard in the place, and it’s not against the rules to wear your headphones in the facility.  

Am I the asshole?  I paid money to have a pass to use this place, I use it consistently, while following the rules and cleaning up after myself.  Is there some sort of un-written rule I don’t know?",NTA lots of folks wear headphones to work out as well as for sensory issues.

My boyfriend and I were the first to arrive at my aunt's place and we all sat down in the living room for cup of tea whilst we waited for everyone else to arrive. Everything was alright at first, although a little awkward. That was until I noticed something on the cabinet in front of me. It was my mum's financial disclosure, which both my parents had to provide to the other's solicitor. 

Straight away alarm bells started ringing. Why the hell was my mum's disclosure at my aunt's house?! Which, by the way, is also a bed and breakfast house. My uncle had been telling my boyfriend and I earlier, when he picked us up, that they had guests as well. It was so easily accessible to anyone. 

Now, when my parents first separated, he did go and stay with his sister's before moving in with my grandparents. But as far as I'm concerned, nothing like that should be there at his sister's.

Eventually my uncle moved it and put it away, but it was still getting to me. So I did the only thing I thought I could do. Message my mum and tell her it was there. Obviously she was fuming and told her solicitor, but I went about the rest of the day being uneasy but trying to have a nice time for my dad's sake. After all, it was his birthday. I could talk to him about it after. 

When it was all over and I got back to my place that night, I called my mum to ask how she was. She went on to tell me that her solicitor was not at all happy and would be contacting my dad's solicitor. Fair enough. We all agreed it was a breach of confidentiality after all. 

I was expecting a shit storm from my dad and his family. But it was quiet all week up until last night. I got a message from my dad. To sum it up, he said he couldn't trust me and that I should never repeat anything I see or hear. That hurt like hell. It really fucking hurt. 

I told him why I did it. That had it been the other way around, I would have done the exact same. I'm not taking sides. But I couldn't stand by and let it slide. I know it looked like I was going out my way to do it, but it was literally right there. Big and bold for everyone to see. It wasn't out the way or kept safe. 

He then replied.

He has cut me out. Said he won't talk to me for the foreseeable future. 

I was a fucking mess last night. But the more I have thought about it, the more I wonder... AITA?

TL;DR: I told my mum about something my aunt had of hers involving my parents' divorce. My dad has cut me out of his life saying he can't trust me.","NTA. Your dad was not supposed to have that there. He was in the wrong and most likely knows it. If your father is willing to do this to you, for doing the right thing rather than accepting his fault, then it’s his loss, but I am so sorry you're going through this.","NTA. Not at all. You were protecting your mother’s privacy. A document like that is confidential and should not be readily accessible to the people not involved, let alone strangers at a B&amp;B. Your dad sounds like he really overreacted, and he should respect the fact that your actions are purely in the interest of maintaining your mother’s privacy. You possibly could have brought it to your dad’s attention first, but you mentioned that your dad has been making this difficult for everyone. I would say NAH if your dad had been very amicable through this whole process and just accidentally left it out, but since it sounds like he’s been a big problem throughout, I say NTA",0,0
9qia4c,"A few months back I was hired to babysit for a new family. This was only my second babysitting job, at the time I didn't know to schedule a meeting or anything ahead of time. I showed up and only then did the mom tell me that one of the kids has autism (i'll call him James, he was about 13 btw) and the other one has ADHD (I'll call him dylan, he was like 9 i think) and was not medicated or anything while I babysat.

I have no background or training in either of these. I have adhd, but idk how to handle an adhd child. It ended up as a disaster. Dylan was alright for the first hour or two since he just watched videos on his ipad the entire time, but when James discovered that his parents were gone (I found out later that the parents hadn't told james they were leaving) he freaked out. He started yelling ""what are you doing in my house?!! get out"" and started hitting me with a drum stick he had and climbing on me, pinching me, biting me, and anything else he could do to hurt me. Then Dylan took this opportunity to run off and grab mini cupcakes and start eating them. I ended up having to try to fight him for the cupcakes while James was still trying to hurt me.

This goes on for about 3 hours until the parents came home. I told them exactly what happened. They kind of shrugged it off and didn't even offer me any sort of extra compensation or apology.

They're now trying to convince me to babysit again, saying they only left that info out because nobody would if they mentioned it and they really need a babysitter. 

She said the medicine and stuff for their kids costs so much they can't afford a specialized babysitter for special needs

They said that when they disclose that the children are special needs it scares nearly everyone off and they can never get any kind of alone time outside of the house because their kids require so much attention

Idk if I'm a bad person for refusing or wanting more money for my trouble. I genuinely can see their side of it, but also I'm terrified of going back into that house.

EDIT: added more info on their side to clarify their reasoning for not being able to pay more for a qualified sitter","NTA. I’ve heard of parents doing this before and they’re only harming themselves. If you have no training and don’t feel comfortable looking after the kids, you shouldn’t. 

It’s the parents’ responsibility to find a good babysitter. And if they can’t afford it, they can’t go out. That’s unfortunately part of the sacrifices that comes with being a parent ","NTA. 

There’s charities and church groups that offer these things, at least in medium sized towns and larger.  Also, there’s parents groups that trade babysitting.

The woman he's marrying is pregnant, technically making it 13.

This is marriage 4 and of all 13 kids, there are 6 different mothers. Every child has been invited to this wedding. I have only met the 18y/o step brother and my full siblings, the others I've only heard about in passing.

My relationship with dad is tricky at best. He and mum were on and off while me and my full siblings were younger, and when he was at home there was basically always a 50/50 chance he'd be in a good mood or a bad one. When he was in a good mood things were fine. When he was in a bad mood it was awful. When I was 10 I hit puberty, and he took my bedroom door off it's hinges in case I brought a boy home. If my room was ever the slightest bit messy (so much as a t shirt on the floor) he'd come in and pull my things off shelves and out of drawers saying ""if you want to live in a dump I'll help you on your way"". He never hit me but he would call me names and put me down, and it lasted until mum divorced him when I was 11. When I was 16, I told him I was a lesbian, and he didn't say anything, just got up and left, and I didn't hear from him after that until a year ago. To this day, he has never shown remorse for his actions.

The kids under 18 don't have much of a choice in going to the wedding as he has at least partial custody of all of them, but the ones over 12 get more of a say than the ones under 12. As I'm 20, I don't have to go. However, my younger siblings (the full ones) have said they are all going and would love for me to be there, and dad has also rung me and asked me to come. He even said I could bring my girlfriend as a +1. He also said that when I get there, ""we should have a long talk, somewhere private. I know I haven't always been the best dad but I have some stuff I need to get off my chest"".

The wedding is at a church and the reception is at a hotel, both about a 2 hour drive from mine and my girlfriend's place. Dad has offered to pay for the room, cover any bar or room service, and give us gas money. We'd be driving there a few days before the wedding for wedding prep eg rehearsal dinners and leaving the morning after the reception. Both me and my girlfriend are on summer break from uni and work remotely, so we could easily go, work in the hotel room between events, and not lose any work/money.

While my attitude to dad is complicated at best, he has some stuff he wants to say to me and my girlfriend thinks I should hear him out, and my younger siblings, who I love and would do anything for, really want me to come.

The wedding is a few months away and I'm still undecided as to what I'm doing.

WIBTA if I didn't go?","NTA.

&gt; ""we should have a long talk, somewhere private. I know I haven't always been the best dad but I have some stuff I need to get off my chest""

IT'S A TRAP.  You hope he's going to apologize, but in all likelihood he is going to explain to you why he was right all along.  Dude emotionally abused you.  He has given you no reason to believe he's turned over a new leaf.   If he actually wanted to apologize, he could be doing it over the phone, or in a letter; he wouldn't wait until you literally were trapped.  That's what ""we should have a long talk, somewhere private."" means.

It would be good to explain to your girlfriend that your dad emotionally abused you, and that being around an abuser isn't good for you.  She may be putting her ideal of happy families ahead of the reality of your unhappy family.","NTA - it would be nice if you did go, but you don't owe it to him. You don't care about your relationship with him and I don't blame you, but it could be nice to go for your siblings. Other than that, whatever you do here you're not the asshole",0,0
amcmbe,"(throwaway because my wife browses reddit and she’ll know this about her straight away, sorry for any formatting errors, I’m on mobile, TLDR at the end, etc)

First of all, I know I’m not perfect, but please hear me out. I don’t know where to start so I’ll just get the elephant in the room out of the way:

I’ve (29/M) been cheating on my wife (31/F) for a little over a year now, with another woman (20/F) that I think I love. 

My wife and I met in college (UK - I think that’s high school in America?) and dated for about two years before I proposed. Things were smooth for almost a year, before my wife seemed to change. She was constantly rude, nagging at me for anything, making belittling comments. I began to spend more time at work to avoid her constant negativity. She was diagnosed with Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. Still, I was sure we’d work through it, so I stayed with her. I believed I still loved her. 

Two years after her diagnosis, my dad died in a car crash. While I was distraught, I couldn’t help but notice that my wife seemed almost glad. She’d never mentioned an issue with my parents, but any time I seemed sad about it, she’s say something like, “It’s for the best,” or “You should get over it soon.” 

My brother took his loss harder than I did and turned to alcohol. As a favour, I took him in when his landlord turned him out. I work a lot, but my wife owns her own business and often works from home. I (wrongly) assumed that I could leave the two of them alone together, but while I was away, they would have sex. I found this out from a neighbour, who walked in on them when asking for a parcel. I also later found out he had been stealing from us as well. 

As any sane person would, I kicked him out of my home. I tried to file for a divorce, but my wife went through an awful depressive episode, lasting almost a month. I dropped the ideas about a divorce. 

For a while, things seemed to go back to how they were when I was 20. Things were going great at work and I was climbing the ranks. We’d just moved into a new house closer to my work. My wife had begun branching out and now owned two or three shops in the city. She was on a new medication that made her a much more pleasant person. Our sex life was great. 

And then we found out she was having a baby. I was ecstatic - I love kids. My wife and I had always wanted a kid, but every time we’d tried it hadn’t worked. Soon enough, our son was born. 

Over the course of his first couple of months, I began to have doubts that he was really my son. I put this off as first kid worries or whatever and continued with my life. Until one evening, my wife sat me down and told me the kid was my brothers. Her reasons were that ‘she knew I’d always wanted a kid’ and that ‘our DNA was too close for it to make a difference’. Never mind the fact that meant she was sleeping with my brother again. 

Again, I distanced myself. I tried to file for a divorce again, but my wife returned to her depressive state, so once again, I dropped it. One night after an argument, I left the house with no intention of going anywhere and ended up in a bar. I got talking to a girl and we had a one night stand. 

I couldn’t help but think of my wife the whole time, and yet a week later I slept with her again. She told me things about herself - she was living with her cousin, she worked two jobs to put herself through uni, she felt like she was alone in the world. Our one night stand became a whole relationship and I realised that I was cheating on my wife. 

It became a lot easier when I made her my secretary. I don’t want to explain many details about our relationship. She was by no means at fault. I didn’t tell her I had a wife until a month or so before I gave her the job. I didn’t tell her about my son until our first argument. 

I was spending a lot more time at work, and my wife began getting suspicious. She stopped taking her meds, telling me they ‘clouded her thoughts’ and refused to speak with her psychiatrist. Still, she doesn’t know about the other woman. 

Really, I know I am at fault for a lot of this, and a tragic backstory or whatever doesn’t let me off. But I really do think I’m in love with the woman I’m cheating with and I don’t know what to do.

TLDR: my wife, who suffers from multiple mental illnesses, has put me through numerous hardships and now I’m cheating on her. Am I the asshole?","""Guy writes 15 paragraphs to justify cheating""","ESH Your wife had mental disorders that made her an unpleasant person to be around but you tried to stick with it. You did something nice to your brother when he was going through a loss. He repaid that loss with sleeping with your wife and stealing from you. Your reaction to your wife telling you that 'your child' was actually your brothers is somewhat justified.

The keyword there is somewhat. You still cheated on your wife instead of divorcing her when you had plenty of chances. I will acknowledge your care for her feelings when you suggested filing for divorce and opting not to when she went into a depressive state.

Nevertheless, you still cheated on her instead of doing the right thing and divorcing her. ",1,2
evlfao,"I have 3 roomates everyone in the dorm is under 21. Ive contributed alot to the dorm as a whole by willingly let them use my TV. I also provided the microwave, coffe machine, tv apps, printer, car services and almost all the groceries and cleaning supplies.


For this story it'll be abour roomate 1 Casey. Roommate 2 who'll be Jessica, mutual friend Ben, roommate 3 Meg and Megs boy friend Anthony. Names changed.


4 months ago Casey's bf broke up with her. Eveyone has been comforting her as much as possible but she turned to alcohol. Its out of hand and the cops came and got her Jessica and a few friends to get a mark on their record. We all thought that would cause her control herself while drinking or stop.


Nope, here we are with her drinking almost daily. She has angered Ben, and Jessica by getting physically and emotionally agressive with them causing them to storm out and not come back. Meg doesn't care and stays out of everything while Anthony will side with her. Since then she has sat down and told Ben and Jessica she'll control herself.


But 2 weeks ago she got drunk and started to cry and scream at people at 4 in the morning causing Jessica to storm out when she told her to fuck herself. And Ben leaving shortly after as she told him he needs to f himself and leave her the f alone. I helped Ben grab his stuff and take the alcohol with him so she cant get any worse. This caused her to lock herself in her room and cry my name at the top of her lungs. I checked on her and she started ranting to me about how her life sucks and no one understands. I tried telling her that this is a discussions for when she is sober. Where she proceeded to call me a b****, c**t and motherf and started to get angry and aggressive. I walked away and went to bed. The next morning I told Ben and Jessica about what happend after they left. 


Since then myself, Ben and Jessica havent talked with her and we refuse to till she seeks help. Which we tried to do with her in the past sitting down and talking with her and offering her the free resources on campus. And we want a real apology: in the past they have been "" Im sorry but you guys need to leave me alone."" 


Since then I have taken any groceries I buy I do the same thing and once more if asked I'll give it to them. Eveyone but Casey. So today she was in the front and noticed she was using the TV. I asked her for the remote and to sum it up she wouldnt because she lives here too and wont apologize cause I'm a liar.


I  left the room and texted Anthony since he talks with her and asked what she is talking about. She gave him a diffrent story and says that I'm a liar. She says that I'm being an asshole for taking everything into my room because we all live together. I think I'm being reasonable as I'm only taking things that are not a necessity. Everyone has a meal plan and a TV is not mandatory for survival just entertainment.


So wibta if I take the TV into my room?


Update


Hey guys so an update and sorry to say its not a good one. I found out that Casey has apologised to everyone in the dorm that night but me. And for the past week everyone in the dorm has been hiding it from me by waiting for me to go out or bed to take things from my room and use them. Because I wasn't there and therefore couldn't be hurt. So I did end up taking the TV into my room and getting a lock on my door. Now everyone is mad at me and again I'm being alianted. I did try and sit down and talk with them but it turned into a full on yelling match with me leaving in tears. Hopefully things will get better.",[deleted],"NTA

You paid for it. It's yours to do with as you wish.
You tried helping her but she's a train wreck and needs to deal with it on her own. Either she moves out and back home or she starts going to therapy and AA meetings.

Your responsibilities over this alcoholic ends here. Look after yourself and put a lock on your room in case she wants to destroy your things. Addicts can get vindictive and petty because they have no coping mechanisms left over their emotions. Which in turn can make them dangerous people.",0,0

ed6ru9,"I was on my way home from bringing my dog to the vet and had to take a busy interstate during rush hour to get home, and was driving in the far right lane. At one point the car in front of me got cut off and I had to stop short to avoid an accident, which caused the car behind me to hit me. I've been in these situations before and the first thought in my mind was to get that police report. Once I pull over to the side to assess the situation, I first check on my dog if he was okay ( he was fine), then I get out and ask the driver if she was okay and she said ""yeah I'm okay, I didn't hit you too hard"", which I agreed, but immediately told her that I was calling the police to report it. At this point she started getting aggravated and threw her hands in the air and angrily walked back to her car, so I just went back to mine to call the police and to gather my info for the officer. 

Once the officer arrives, he looks at the damage and says it doesn't look that bad, and I agreed it didn't look like a lot of damage, but I know there could be more damage behind the scratches on the bumper. The girl then huffs and puffs as the officer looks at me again and asks what I want to do, so I say ""I definitely still want a report done"", and he kinda made a wide-eyed look and said ""okay then"". As the officer is writing up the report I go back to my car to warm up and check on the pup, and as I'm sitting there the girl taps on my window and asks if there is any way I can ask the officer to not write up the report, and I said absolutely not. At this point I explain to her that I've been burned by this before where I didn't get a report and I got screwed and was stuck with $700 worth of damage to my previous car. She then plays the victim card and says how bad of a day she's had and blah blah blah, but I just didn't want to hear it and told her there was nothing that would change my mind. This then made her start to tear up and I honestly did start feeling bad for the girl, but I was adamant about my decision. So as the small bickering went on, she then turned angry again and said ""I can't believe you're doing this to someone during the holidays, have a Merry Christmas! (sarcastic tone)"", and she went back to her car. I waited a few minutes and walked over to her car to try to sort of calm her down and make some sort of peace, although I didn't know the girl, I still really didn't want to ruin the girls day from an accident that she couldn't really avoid. She again started sobbing a bit, but just explained to her that I felt this was the right thing to do, and I was not changing my mind.

There could be more damage to the frame that you can't see.

dkz6z4,"AITA for being pissed that my ex was invited to my workplace by my best friend?

I’ve known my best friend for nearly 10 years. We are close because I started teaching two of her children many years ago when they were small. I am close to the whole family. 

Coincidentally, the two oldest children now attend the secondary school that I work at, one will be graduating this year.


I have been going through a rough break up with my ex fiancé. We were together for 3.5 years and in that time he also became close to the family.


My bf has been supportive. I’ve spent a lot of time with the family over the past few months. My friend assured me that they were there to support me and more cordial with the ex. I’ve asked the ex for space and time concerning these particular friends. He understands, though he doesn’t like it and thinks that we should all hang out just like old times immediately.


Most recently, my bf suggested that maybe I end counseling with the ex and stop seeing him because of how he is impacting my mental and emotional health.


A few days after bf and I have this conversation she tells me as an FYI that the oldest child is considering asking ex to stand in a place of honor at a school event that requires a father. Their father cannot participate due to a surgery he just had. I am a little stunned and because bf and I just had a conversation about me not seeing ex and now he is potentially invited to my workplace. I think that it’s not about me and it’s for the kid so I don’t say anything at the time. 


I figure that I will mull over the strong negative feelings I am having about this before saying anything. I think that maybe I am being selfish about not wanting ex there since it’s for the kids.


Ex reaches out a few days later to let me know that bf has invited him and he’s excited to participate. I communicate to him that I am uncomfortable with him being in my workplace and I am hurt about the whole ordeal. He says he’s sorry that I’m hurt but that it’s his right to be there based on the invite.


I express to bf that I am hurt by the whole idea and that ex being in my workplace makes me uncomfortable. She apologizes and as an afterthought, officially invites me to the event. Invites me over to the house with ex and other family members before the event. At this point I make it clear that I am actually pissed and that I have no desire to be around ex, even if for the kids and I thought she knew that. She is the one who said I should be more forceful about putting space between us.


Ex sends me messages telling me that they all love me and want me to attend the event and that I should be adult enough to be amicable with him for the kids. It’s infuriating and honestly humiliating to me.


I have decided not to attend the event made other plans. I don’t think that my bf understands how betrayed I feel and I am reconsidering this friendship after all these years.
AITA?","NTA

To be honest, I'd understand a little more if the father wasn't around at all. But he's just unwell. I don't understand why it's so dire that they participate in this even though it means replacing their father and upsetting you.","I’m going to say NAH. But this is probably the first case where I think NAH could almost be replaced with ESH. Break ups can be excruciatingly painful and I’m sorry for the trouble you’re going through. 

I would hope that your BF would explain the situation to their child, but it sounds like your ex has a relationship with this family and maybe even specifically with this child. If the child’s father can’t be a part of the ceremony it’s not fair to make them stand up their without a representative of their choice. 

You shouldn’t be forced to avoid the ceremony, but you also shouldn’t feel bad about avoiding any after party.

bbbbhe,"My 10yo kid has been saving his money (birthday, allowance etc) for months now to get a Nintendo Switch so he can play BOTW. Right now he has $200 saved up. At his current allowance ($10/week) it will still take him months to be able to afford it.

I know he really wants it as all of his friends have one, and he hasn’t been obnoxious about it - just diligently saving up his money. Now I have to say, he’s a really good kid. Kind, smart, does his chores without complaining, friendly to everyone. He’s been making great grades in school and was even made captain of his soccer team.

Instead of making him do more chores to earn more money, I thought of a more fun solution to help him get his Switch. I told him, if you can beat Ocarina of Time (without Googling for help - though I would help him along the way if he got stuck) on my old N64, I’ll pay for the rest of your Switch and get you BOTW. Wife was initially opposed to the idea but then thought it could be a fun father son bonding thing, so she went along with it. Part of my reasoning too is I just want him to appreciate how far video games have come, and OoT is a timeless classic. 

He jumped at the idea! After a weekend of playing, he’s already at Zoras domain as young link. He seems to be having fun with it and hasn’t gotten too frustrated yet. He’s only played Minecraft really so the dated graphics don’t bother him either. 

But anyway I told a couple friends about it, and they think I’m a massive dick. That I’m trying to relive my childhood vicariously through my son, and that I should just get him the Switch because he’s already such a good kid.

edc1mf,"In my country, it is customary for employers to give their employees small stipidends or bonuses around christmas time. I work in an office with the 3 owners and a couple of very good friends of the owners who pretty much work there.

Anywho, we all work in the same lin of work and I've given my input and/or actually concieved ideas that were taken up upon (and money was made through them). I don't really expect anything in return for it, it's my job, if any of them want to give me something for my work it's on them.

One of the owner's friends who basically works there ~~said~~ told me that he wanted to give me a small bonus (if it sounds weird, it's a cultural thing, just bear with me). I was really thankful as it was a good amount of money. That was 3 weeks ago and it hasn't really arrived yet. I don't want to pry, but this person is really forgetful and really prone to have messed up the bank transfer. But also, I don't really want to ask as it kinda sounds rude and out of place, especially since it's a gift. Also, it'd come off as me implying that he's forgetful.

By that I meant that he told me directly.","NAH - You could ask it in a way that emphasizes your gratitude for being recognized; ask if he was *able* to arrange a bonus - that way it's not about his forgetfulness, it's simply about if there will be a bonus or not.","NAH - I wouldn't ask him about it, but I'd thank him again for it.

eagpxa,"Background: my Mother turned 60 this year and about six months ago she reached out to me telling me she was lonely and wanted me to move back in to her house. At the time I was renting a place, but agreed and moved back in. I pay rent and have done various repairs or upgrades to her house. I also take care of a majority of the bills.

Friday nights when I come home from work she tends to stay up waiting for me (I work until 10PM) and makes me a meal. I usually always appreciate it and constantly tell her she doesn't need to cook for me.

The issue: I came home tonight after work and she had another meal waiting for me. We sat down and ate and talked. She asked me how I enjoyed the meal and I told her I enjoyed it.

She then smiles and tells me she was out of ginger so put some of her ginger essential oils in the food. 

Why is this a issue? Because she knows I hate essential oils. I think it's unregulated snake oil house wives sell to other uninformed customers while making all sorts of grand claims.

More importantly she had a very bad allergic reaction to using Doterra essential oils last year which resulted in her being in the hospital for two days.

She knows that I have personally reached out to my state senator and district attorney requesting significantly better regulations on these products and that I hate she continues to use them and buy them from her friend who works in a salon.

For me, food is a very personal experience and I don't like people messing with my food. She is well aware of that. 

If someone told me that they didn't eat rabbit, for whatever reason, I wouldn't cook them a meal, feed them rabbit and then tell them after the fact. I think that is a massive betrayal of trust.

When I told her the meal was fine, but then voiced my displeasure of what she had done, she blew it off and said that I was being completely unreasonable, got huffy and then went to bed without saying good night.

I just got done talking with my friend who said it wasn't that big of a deal. But now I feel like I have to question any sort of food she presents to me. And she always gets pissed off if I turn down anything she makes.

AITA for being pissed off about this? To me it would be the same if someone doped my drink.

TLDR: Mom made me a meal that included essential oils even though she knows I despise them and waited until after I had finished my meal to tell me.","NTA, essential oils are not regulated by the FDA and are not a food product, therefore they shouldn't be eaten or put in food. You have every right to be upset, and I personally would stop eating food that she cooks, although that might be an overreaction/might lead to a bigger problem.","Are you sure she fed you essential oils, and not just ginger-infused olive/peanut/some other kind of oil?",0,0
ep8ytw,"Today I'm here to ask AITA for not wanting to send my MIL baby pics anymore. I think it's obvious already that I could very well be the asshole.

Some back story: I don't talk to my mom (we'll call her CC). It's very necessary we have NO CONTACT with CC. Emotional abuse, lying, sharing our home address, &amp; other toxic bs. It's been 5 years now. I have CC blocked on everything but she uses friends, family, &amp; burner accts to steal pics &amp; info about my family. Bcuz of this I ask that pics of my kids not be shared online.

Great! Or so I thought, until my dad (divorced) shows me pics of my kids that CC sent him. Pics taken &amp; shared by my MIL. MIL is aware of CC's behavior (known MIL for +12yrs) &amp; my request not to share pics. MIL is older &amp; doesn't fully grasp FB. Due to this she didn't just post them to her personal page but the pics were public, to those on &amp; off FB. MIL says that she didn't know they were public &amp; made them visible to friends &amp; blocks CC. I wanted them removed but I let it go. Good enough.

A few years pass &amp; we find out we're expecting! We decide not to tell anyone the entire pregnancy. [This is another possible AITA] I don't want the info shared by anyone (like MIL) &amp; have CC find out. At this point CC is showing up at our home uninvited &amp; PMing my friends &amp; relatives to harass me. I didn't feel safe. We can't tell other fam but not MIL so we decide to keep the whole thing a secret. 

9ms later baby L arrives! We make plans to see MIL &amp; show her baby L as a surprise (15min drive). MIL's birthday is the next weekend &amp; I think it's an unbeatable gift, her first granddaughter &amp; none of the waiting! While there we explain we do not want anything about baby shared online bcuz of CC. No birthday, birth stats, gender, name, NOTHING. MIL agrees. 

We vaguely announce &amp; ask ppl to msg me for baby details. I make it very clear, in writing, DO NOT share ANYTHING online! Again, MIL sees &amp; agrees to this. I send MIL a lot of pics of baby &amp; other kids, thinking she understands! Obviously we all know where this is going.

I log onto FB after a visit &amp; MIL's public profile picture is baby L! I contact MIL &amp; express that I do not want that pic posted, &amp; that it is very much public to ANYONE &amp; CC can see/steal it. MIL says she blocked CC so it's okay. It's NOT okay with me &amp; I ask my SO to talk to her. MIL again apologizes, &amp; reluctantly changes her profile picture. MIL doesn't delete the pic, but makes it visible to only friends. 

I'm livid but I drop it. A month later I walk out onto our porch &amp; there sits a pair of little girl shoes. CC dropped off a present to let me know she saw the pic &amp; to reinforce that my home isn't safe from her. Now I will not send MIL pics &amp; she keeps asking my SO for them. I feel guilty but idk what else to do. Am I The Asshole for not wanting to send pictures anymore?

db63z6,"This happened a couple of years back, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter.

Some friends and I were having a hypothetical talk about pregnancy.  I think someone we knew was pregnant which is why the topic came up in the first place. None of us having this discussion were pregnant (it happened awhile ago) but one of my friends said that they can't wait to be pregnant and let us know about it. I mentioned that if I ever got pregnant, I'd wait till at least 4 months or so have passed before telling anyone. I've heard that the first trimester is when the most miscarriages happen, so I don't really see the point in sharing that news with friends until after the first trimester is over. You can still suffer a miscarriage, but at least the first hurdle would be out the way.

I explained this, but my friend said that this would be a douchie thing to do. Friends should tell friends when they're pregnant and she would tell me. This is all hypothetical, so things could change but it was a discussion that made me think about whether not telling someone is an horrible thing to do.

So, can you guys solve this problem for us. WIBTA if I don't tell my friends if I'm pregnant until after the first trimester is over?","NTA
I know plenty of people who did that, it's not a big deal.","NTA - you get to choose who you tell when. 
However, I personally don’t understand not telling the people you’re closest to until the second trimester because there’s a higher chance of miscarriage. If you have a miscarriage, you’d probably want support from those close friends.",0,0

I’ve been with my current girlfriend for a little over a year. We work different shifts and do not live together so we typically only see each other one or two days during the week. 

We call/time/FaceTime throughout the week and when my SO is feeling frisky, she’ll send me nude photos and we’ll engage in some sexy talk/sext. 

Yesterday while I was at work, I got a notification that she had sent me a photo. 

“Oh hell yeah,” I think as I open it and see a photo of my SO’s lady bits. 

However as I’m looking at it something catches my eye. On closer inspection I notice it’s a tampon string. 

I reply with a “?” And she asks what’s wrong. 

I point out the string and she doesn’t see what the big deal is. She tells me I’m shaming her for something she can’t control. I tell her I’m not, but that I don’t want to see that. 

We argue throughout the night about this, and she didn’t pick up my phone calls last night. We haven’t talked today either.

bc2y9l,"Let me start off with I am 23F and have three half siblings (28F, 25M, 20M). We were all raised by our father's and for the most part our mother has been absent in most of our lives. She had been close with my sister for a little bit but burnt that bridge by being selfish and treating my sister and her children poorly. My oldest brother always tried to be close with her, but mom always brushed him off/used him for bail money. Same with my youngest brother. I have never held a conversation with my mother, and have only seen her briefly maybe 6 times my entire life. Mom had a serious history of drug abuse as well.

We found out that she is on life support and things look pretty bad. Since she cut contact with the entire family and had no designated POA it was left up to all interested parties to nominate someone to hold control over medical conditions (it's a weird state law). My sister wanted nothing to do with it, my older brother can't handle the stress right now and we all agreed that the youngest is, well, the youngest and we don't want that burden on him. That left me, the one child that she has never even hugged and that knows her the least. I offered up our uncle, but he wanted it to be me as well.

The rest of the family wants it to be one of us, as they feel that is most appropriate. I want the best for her medical care, but after speaking with her doctor and nurses she won't be coming out of this/is brain dead.

I feel like shit to be the one that has to make the decision. I don't even know if she ever loved me, or if she would be okay with me being the one in this position. I would like to be clear that I am only operating with support of the immediate family and won't make a decision if majority rules against something. That being said, the siblings all agree on discontinuing life support soon as keeping her on it feels selfish and wrong.

AITA for holding the life of someone who is essentially a stranger in my hands and leaning towards pulling the plug?

Edit: thank you to everyone that has replied, it really means a lot and helps me feel more comfortable with this.","NAH

No one is ever really ready to be in the position, it doesn't matter how close you are. That's why the doctors and nurses are there, telling you what the reality is. She's not going to wake up.

You aren't pulling the plug for fun or for vengeance, you're following their advice and your family's wishes.","NAH.  If doctor's are saying she is brain dead there is no other course of action.  I had to be part of this with my father and I knew and loved him.  When they did the testing and it was clear he was brain dead, there was no choice really.  It was time to turn the machines off.

I’m currently in a class at university that requires a heavy amount of in-class participation and office hour visitations to pass.  This wouldn’t be an issue if it wasn’t for my professor.

My professor - let’s call him Pete - has very little hygiene.  He smells like a combination of bodily fluids and sweat, which makes it hard to be around him.  It’s gotten particularly bad in the past week since he has the flu.  He smells so bad that it’s impossible to breathe through your nose around him.

There could very well be a medical reason for this or he could be in a bad mental place. It’s time for his superior to check in and see if he’s ok. If no one says anything they will not know.

bci37f,"Im in an LDR of sorts with my boyfriend (same state but no way to see eachother readily) who's had a rough hand dealt to him in life. I won't divulge much detail but his parents were extremely abusive which set him back a lot in terms of opportunity. Everything he currently has, he's worked hard for which I admire him for. But because of this lack of opportunity and resources, he doesn't have a place of his own. He lives with his brother who he has helped get an apartment for with his gf. He isn't on the lease but he was told he could stay for as long as he needs to.

His plan was to eventually move out of the apartment and move in with a male friend, but due to unforseen circumstances that friend is no longer able to accomodate him. His next choice was to move in with a woman, an online friend of his whom I don't know much about and haven't met. She even offered to help pay for vet expenses for his cat. I trust my boyfriend but I don't trust her and I'm wary of this living arrangement. He's reassured me that they established early on that no romance would be between them but I'm not sure she even knows who I am and that I'm with him and I feel she could make a move anytime she chooses...

She wanted her deposit back ASAP and I said it wasn’t as agreed and she would be getting back about $30 because we still had the electricity/water/gas bill to pay. I said I would check my bank account to see how much deposit she had paid - and I noticed she hadn’t paid a months rent! 

So I told her about this before I left and she was like “yeah I have” and I have the receipt to show it. I had mistakenly sent a receipt because she had paid one rent payment three weeks late and I thought she was early paying the rent. She would always ask me for receipts, which kinda meant nothing in my eyes and my other two house mates didn’t request them. 

I went to my home country for 3.5 weeks and by the end of the trip she was still staying she had paid the rent correctly. It’s not too hard to work out how many months you’ve lived in a house (14 months) and the rent you had paid.

She blocked me on all social media and messages so I found out where she now lived, knocked on her door, so response so left a letter taped to her car and front door. 

Her dad called me saying I was harassing her - so I told her she owed me rent etc. The housemate claimed she had paid it the Friday and on Sunday I still hadn’t received it. However Monday I had received the money - transfers take a couple of hours. So she had lied to me and her dad. 

Am I the asshole for leaving a note on the front door of my old housemate who owed me money?

bierhk,"So almost a year ago, my mother passed away from really aggressive bone cancer (metastatic pelvic sarcoma). She hadn’t been able to walk for some time and was essentially just stuck on the couch not able to get up even to go to the bathroom. 
We finally got a doctor to come to the house and they immediately decided that she needed to be taken to the hospital right away.
My dad went with her and was at the hospital for about a week while I stayed home and kept things in order while also going to work. They performed a biopsy and discovered that the cancer was eating away at her hip and quite obviously terminal.

Fast forward a week or two. My mom is staying in a nursing facility on an air mattress because anything else is too painful for her to lay on. The slightest movement and she’s in agonizing pain and she screams out. I know this because that’s how it was when she was still at home on the couch.

Some friends and I drove up to the nursing facility to visit her. When we got there, there was a set of double doors where you had to get buzzed in. We pressed the button to be let in and from behind the doors I heard shrieks of pain that I recognized to be my moms. 
I couldn’t do it. I just did not have the strength to see her like that so we left and she died later that week.

The last time I saw her was when they were taking her out of the house on a gurney. I hugged her and told her I loved her and that I’d see her soon. But that was the last time.
I’ve told my dad how I felt and he doesn’t blame me for not wanting to see her like that (he was up there everyday and said that towards the end it wasn’t pretty). 
I just can’t shake the thought of my mom laying in that room looking at the door waiting for her only son to walk in and comfort her. AITA?","NAH. Everyone deals with death differently and your response of not wanting to see someone you love in so much pain is really common. Be kind to yourself, OP. From the sounds of it, she knew you loved her.","

dvb8nv,"So yesterday my girlfriend of almost a month (have been talking for over 2) and I were hanging out and just relaxing. She then randomly gets a snap from someone followed by an Instagram message from the same person that said something along the lines of ""Please don't open that snap. I didn't mean to send that to you, and it is super embarrassing."" She messages him back and asks why and they go back and forth until he eventually says ""You can open it if you want to."" Well she does with me watching and it is a video of him pulling down his shorts to show his full erection. She immediately closes, and I am kinda just sitting there stunned. I then am like who is this guy? How do you know him? etc etc. She says that they talked back in the summer, but nothing really happened and it didn't go anywhere. I then asked her to delete him from Snapchat which she did without much if any protest and seemed fine to delete him, but I kinda feel bad. I'm not the type of guy who gets mad or jealous if my significant other has friends of the opposite sex and would never ask her to remove or block someone from social media without reason, but I feel like in this case it is justified. AITA?

Edit: I should clarify between asked her and made her delete him. I guess the more appropriate wording would be that I insisted that she delete him. I wouldn't have taken her phone and deleted him off of there or anything like that, but if she would've refused I would have been upset to say the least.","NAH. I think you are justified in wanting your girlfriend to delete a guy who sent her a vid like that.  She obviously wasn't interested, so even if she didn't delete him doesn't seem like you'd have anything to worry about.","INFO: I know you tried to explain what you meant by “made her” in the edit, but I still think we’re missing some context on what you actually said, and how it came across. There’s a subtle but important difference between asking, suggesting, and demanding. For example:

**Asking**:
It makes me really uncomfortable that someone would send you a video like that. Can you delete his contact? (N-T-A)

**Suggesting**:
Wow, what a creep, I can’t believe he sent you that! Just delete him and move on. (N-T-A) 

**Demanding**:
I don’t like other guys sending you a video like that. Delete his contact. (Y-T-A slightly; depends on tone) 

In the first scenario, you’re asking your gf to consider your feelings. In the second, you’re offering a solution to a (presumably) off-putting or annoying problem. In the last, you’re disregarding your gf’s agency in favor of your own feelings. Do you see the difference? It doesn’t matter whether or not you would have been upset if she refused - being upset at something doesn’t make you TA.",3,0
bdnmev,"So throwaway for reasons. Update at the bottom.

2 weeks ago I reached out to a guy that I met some time ago to go on a date, and we did! It went really well and made plans for a second and then a third. I am a little naturally resistant to dating and I wasn’t particularly attentive to his texts. But I always responded, apologized when my response was delayed, and to be fair for going on 2 dates he was a little overzealous with the texting. So our third date was derailed due to a miscommunication and I invited him over last night, but he said he had plans to see the GOT premiere. All is well perfectly understandable.

Cue 730 pm and he texts me that he’s not really interested in the GOT premiere and wants to hang out. I resist initially because I just wanted to relax but he insisted he just wanted to chill for a bit and see me before the workweek. So I invite him over, he gets here at 930, and we watch a show and have a couple glasses of wine. We made out, he told me he really liked me, and I invited him to stay over.

So he did, we slept together and it wasn’t.. great.. he lost his erection pretty quickly and I asked what was wrong and he said nothing but seemed embarrassed. So I was like all good, went to sleep, and when we woke up I asked again if everything was ok. He said no, left and said see you soon! I should mention that I have an ED so my body is whatever the opposite of voluptuous is. My mind immediately went to shit he’s disgusted by my body. So I text him and say “hey, I’m feeling a little weird about last night. Is everything ok? If you aren’t feeling this we can end things here if you want” he responds, “I’m not feeling it, we should end things” 

I texted him back with the following message: “Ok, to wrap things up, I do just want to be clear on what changed last night. I was ambivalent about going on dates and I mentioned above ^ that dating is hard for me right now. I’m feeling a little bit used because you pushed to come over, I invited you to stay over, you said that you liked me, we had sex, I asked you multiple times if something was wrong and you clearly said no, and now you aren’t feeling it. I just want to clarify if it was something I did or said or if I’m just not attractive to you? I can handle the truth but it feels really icky and I feel used and, out of respect, I just want resolution from the situation. I am fine with whatever the reason is, because I definitely wasn’t sure that these dates were going anywhere, but having sex and ending it so abruptly can be really damaging to a person without communication.” 

Am i being super psycho and an asshole, or am I justified in feeling used in thinking he’s a total asshole?

Edit/ Update: So he did respond! He was kind about everything and wrote “Again I’m sorry for last night and not communicating how I felt. That was not fare to you. I was also unsure about the dates we had and if it would go anywhere. I am not as attractive to you as much as I was hoping for. The sex ended prematurely because of the position I was in with my wrist and when I wear a condom I usually need oral before I put the condom on. Those were things I should have said or ask for. I have a hard time expressing how I feel in the moment, it’s something I know I need to work on. I honestly think you are an amazing person and wish you the best. I hope this helps” 

To be honest, I think that was more than fair and I definitely feel relieved that it ended for those reasons, rather than feeling like someone used me to get in my pants. I appreciate all the feedback on this cause I did feel a little crazy asking for a reason, I’ve just never been in a dating situation that had such poor communication and it did my head in when it ended like that. I am grateful that we didn’t continue to date just because we had sex and were on the same page about the actual relationship. Wasn’t going anywhere and in retrospect, I should follow my gut a little more if I find myself resistant/reluctant to dates BEFORE sleeping with a guy and setting better boundaries— that might make me the asshole to begin with. Also, 29 and mixing up fare and fair? Dealbreaker as it is. /s Anyways thanks for the support and input!!","NTA i think what’s probably happened is the guy got nervous got into his own head, it happens especially when you’re inexperienced, lost his erection and felt to embarrassed to tell you the truth. I wouldn’t worry about it on your end.","NTA. He said he liked you then bailed after things got sexual. I'd want an explanation too.

deadoh,"I'm 21m, and in college. I brought up the idea to make margaritas with my friend last night, when he thought it was a good idea, I went out and bought what was needed. It came to $32 total, but the things are that 1) I didn't drink 100% of the booze bought, and 2) a few of us shared it. I haven't asked yet, but I looked at how much booze was left and figured out how much people drank for appropriate prices. I never said anything to the effects of that I'm going to, or not I'm going too charge them. I was just going to wait to see how much booze was left before I charged for not coming off like someone who only cares about the money. 

I have the prices and everything done, but WIBTA if I asked for financial compensation?","YWBTA: If you invited people over, and you provided drinks, it’s rude to ask for money afterward. If you’re not able to pay for everyone, that’s no big deal. Next time, when you invite people, just say hey, I was thinking we could all do drinks tonight. I’ll pick everything up and have it at my place if everyone can help by chipping in $10 for snacks and drinks. Easy peasy.","Depends on the language you chose when you made the arrangement my dude

* ""Lets make margaritas!"" -&gt; you're buying, especially if you ran out and got the stuff and didn't mention anything about the price of said stuff lol
* ""Wanna go in on margaritas with me?"" -&gt; shared costs assumed

YTA

To be clear this is in the context that you go forward with the plan to ask for compensation, which I wouldn't advise. Suggesting its ""your night"" to buy the margaritas would be considered much more socially acceptable and still clearly acknowledges that you bought the margaritas the first night.

anpshh,"TLDR: I (26F) and my gf (30F) has been together for just over a year. A friend who I had one-sided feelings for 5 years ago, planned a trip together with me this weekend, we had invited my gf but she refused to go. Originally it was a trip of three friends. But the third friend backed out. My friend and I still want to go. Everything is booked and paid for. — but once learning it’s gonna be a trip for two, my gf absolutely refuses for this trip to happen, and instantly told me to cancel. 

—-

I (26F) and Friend (27F) has been friends since middle school. Same high school. Same university. We had always been close friends. 5 years ago, I had developed feelings for her, and was promptly rejected. We were/are incompatible and she didn’t return my feelings. We drifted apart for 2 years, I lived out of town for 3. — but my main little group of friends include my Friend. And she is still one of my closest friends (we had mended the friendship in the recent year). 

For the longest time, we had always talked about taking a skating trip to another city close by. We had done it in first year university and had a great time. We wanted to go skating again. This year I’m finally back in town. We promptly planned it. Invited other people, but they were all busy, and one flaked out. We had invited my gf, she did not want to go. Then we planned the trip for a later weekend in Feb, but my gf wanted to spend that weekend with me instead (even though we live together). And insisted on changing the date of the trip. 

So it was changed to this weekend. When my gf isn’t in town. —- my gf asked us to change it! And my Friend had to rearrange other plans in her life, as had I, to make it work. 

Then the third friend flaked. I didn’t tell my gf. It just didn’t occur to me that she’d have a problem with this. I want to go on the trip. So what if it’s a two person trip instead? — but I didn’t neglect to tell her intentionally. I just didn’t think it’d be an issue with her. Gf never had insecurities about this Friend before. 

Last night, she asked me again about the details of the upcoming weekend trip. Fair enough. I was honest. Clarified it was just gonna be two people. 

Instantly, gf freaked out. Went berserk. — saying this is a date instead. A two night three days date. That how could I do this to her. How could I betray her trust like that. — that this trip I’m taking is akin to cheating. 

She instantly started to set rules and boundaries for my friend and I. Apparently I can no longer take the initiative to talk to her. I cannot hang out with her privately. I am to intentionally drift apart from my friend. 

I’m flabbergasted. If I am going to cheat, or had the intention to, it’d be so easy to cover up. Gf isn’t in town. I don’t post on social media. She was even invited to the trip, and, we even changed the date because she wanted more time with me. — and WHY would I cheat??? If my heart and mind isn’t just set on my gf, I’d have just separated with her. 

Just ‘cause I liked my friend for three months 5 years ago, I have to throw away the friendship and the trip? I can say, without any question, that it’s just pure friendship now. And I do not foresee anything festering. Friend is a friend. 

I then refused to cancel the trip. And told my gf we should both reconsider our relationship. She instantly felt personally attacked and is blighted by “You are considering breaking up with me because of HER?” 

No. I’m considering breaking up with you because of your unreasonable controllingness. Your lack of trust in me. And my sadness that you are forcing me to cut off a good friend. 

She didn’t understand. And she couldn’t stand talking to me anymore. Deleted me via the chatting applications. Told me she will not consider Breaking up with me. I can consider alone. And tell her the results via email. 

So. Here I am. AITA? 



Update: 

Trip is cancelled. It’s gloomed over and I rather just wallow in sadness over the weekend. I cancelled because: 

1. With my gf’s outbursts. I cannot enjoy the trip.I no longer have her blessing. 

2. I need to work on my relationship with her. And if I go on this trip, there is no working left. I do not believe she will see past her own insecurities and see it’s just a skating trip. 

So. That’s that. Thank you for all your comments. ","YTA. Dude, come on. You're going out of town alone with a girl you used to like. Are you telling me that if the roles were reversed you wouldn't be even a little suspicious?","YTA I read the end of your post and it's literally no wonder your girlfriend feels insecure with you and the girl you ""used"" to like. Since as soon and she didn't want you to go away with the girl for a one on one weekend you flipped and basically choose breaking up with your girlfriend instead of understanding and putting her before this other girl.

at578d,"I (18m) have been dating my gf (19) for about four months. We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. 

However, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like ""she's dirty"", ""kids are all feral"" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. 

Recently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. 

This really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. 

Also at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.

On the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of ""kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is"". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. ","NTA. Your GF sounds like the living embodiment of the comments section of /r/KidsAreFuckingStupid. She's free not to want children or want to be around them, but she doesn't have to be a complete asshole to them or their parents.   ",ESH. She is obviously an asshole. But she was upfront with you about her outlook and you chose to date her. Getting upset with her makes you an asshole. If you are incompatible you should just break up. ,0,0
e9edkf,"My next door neighbors are going out of town for the holiday season and want to know if they can drop their cat off with me. They’ll be gone about two weeks in another state, and can’t bring the cat with them. I love animals, and have a cat of my own who would love the company, so I enthusiastically agreed to the arrangement. However, apparently, their cat has a habit of getting into the toilet paper, and running all over their house with it in his mouth and ripping it up - basically just wasting their TP. To correct this, they want me to hit the cat with the cardboard part of a wire hanger whenever it shows interest in TP while at my house. They say it’s been working for them and thanks to this technique, he hasn’t gotten into the paper as much and they think they can break the habit if they keep it up. I do *not* want to do that. I’m not doing it. But I also don’t want to tell them I won’t do it, and have them go ask someone else in the neighborhood who *would* do it. They also do other minor nonos, like bathing the cat once a week, letting it outside when it’s not fixed, and feeding it dry food rather than wet which my vet tells me is better. WIBTA if I basically lied and told them I would do what they wanted, but instead just... not?

ETA: Commenters have told me dry food actually *isnt* all that bad for the cat, and changing his diet suddenly would make him sick. I thought most cats eat wet food, my mistake. I’ll leave his food be.

ETA 2: I’m not saying I’m going to change his whole routine. I’m willing to do everything the way they do, except hit the cat, and maybe not let him outside, because I would hate for him to get hurt on my watch.","NTA for everything except the dietary stuff.  It doesn't sound like they're great pet owners, but messing with an animal's diet out of nowhere is just asking for diarrhea.  Vets recommend a mixture of wet and dry food because the wet gives the cat a little extra hydration, but it's far from mandatory.  My cats eat exclusively dry food (for dental reasons) and they're fine.  Don't mess with the food.  But I'd say no, you don't have to hit the cat.  Just keep your bathroom door shut and it becomes a non issue - if they ask, you won't even have to lie.","I’m torn. 

Obviously don’t hit the cat. A can with some pennies in it given a good shake or a spritz with water is effective and not harmful. I don’t care who I’m pet sitting for—I’m not going to hit/abuse an animal and you shouldn’t either. But I would tell them that. “I don’t feel comfortable hitting but I can use these other proven deterrents”

I also think that letting the cat outside is a bad idea for a lot of reasons, but I think you should tell them that if they want you to pet sit, you’re not letting the cat out because it may not come back to you and you don’t want the liability of losing their cat. But you have to tell them this not just say you will and not do it.

As for the food, yep, you’re right. Studies have shown that most cats don’t get properly hydrated with dry kibble alone and are at an increased risk for UTIs and other urinary issues if that’s all that is available. But changing a pet’s diet abruptly comes with other risks and I don’t feel it’s your place to make this judgment call. 

I feel like YWBTA if you smile and nod and agree to all of this and do something completely different without their knowledge.

I’d decline to help if they insist you hit the cat or let it out. But this may be an opportunity to educate so I’d discuss.",3,3
coabzl,"to put it in perspective, this happened like ten minutes ago. i’m a 13 year old and very paranoid but also very empathetic person. i’ve been very nervous about strangers lately because our car was robbed recently. 

so like two hours ago i went down to the local gas station and bought some snacks since i don’t like what my parents left my (12 year old for anybody who cares) brother and i (they went out with friends.) 

so now up to speed like 20/15 minutes ago i was sitting in my living room practicing my song for the school’s musical auditions so i wasn’t really aware of my surroundings (lol i try super hard and get into it.) when my two dogs start freaking out. 

they do this a lot because they’re both super protective and one is very big so everybody knows us as the people with the scary dogs. well anyways i thought this was normal because they always do that at cars passing by but i got kinda nervous like always. then my dogs started kinda throwing themselves at the door and growling and trying to get out so i was like “what’s happening.” 

well i peered out through the glass part of our door and some guy was there so i ran to tell my brother to take his headphones out and look out the window (which views onto the end of our porch where we can see the back of people who come overs heads and decide if we want to open the door.)

the guy wasn’t leaving and just kinda stood there and i knew he already saw me because we made awkward eye contact and he had like no expression so i kinda got nervous. 

i called my dad and asked if he invited a younger guy with dreads (trying to give description) over or something and he said no and that he’ll call the neighbor across the street to check out what’s going on. 

my neighbor came over and told him to leave and asked why he came over. the guy said i dropped a dollar at the store and he was going to give it back to me which i felt really bad that i overreacted if that was the case. 

then i realized i has been home for like two hours before he showed up so did he follow me home and then memorize my address?? i feel really bad and stupid and like i was being dramatic for panicking and like i was being kind of rude. also before anybody calls racist (as i mentioned he had dreads and some people have said that to me before) i’m half black so that’s not it. 

anyways i’d like to know your thoughts. sorry for any bad grammar or formatting i’m on mobile and just rushing through.

EDIT: i just looked outside and my parents cars are there (ig they took an uber or got picked up.) i don’t really think that changes that he literally showed up at my house two hours after i dropped a single dollar, but it might so i thought i’d add it in and also sorry for not mentioning before but i simply didn’t know and never bothered to check before typing this

EDIT 2: however if i opened the door, adults home or no adults home, if he was armed he could have still easily gotten in since all of my family’s guns (mom is a veteran) are locked away and we wouldn’t have time to access

EDIT 3: so i just checked the prices in my mind of what i got (i always get the same things so i did
the math in my head lol) and I NEVER DROPPED A DOLLAR!!!! i had the amount i needed the whole time never dropped one!

EDIT 4: thank you for all the responses! i am safe as my brothers friend and his older sister and i’m friends with picked us up. they were worried since they learned i never actually dropped any cash

FINAL EDIT: so today he either came back or i missed it before but there was a paper on my porch that my dad found. it was literally his snapchat. so we looked him up and learned that he is about to be seventeen and is a popular basketball player at his school. also he is my dads friends neighbor and knows my brother so that’s an oof. thank you all for the kind words and suggestions. still a bit creepy what he did but he’s young and it’s just a learning curve for him. i hope in the future he learns not to approach girls like that and i will not be contacting him on snapchat. please boys if you read this do not do this to a girl no matter what, because it was a super scary feeling for me. i’m still kind of scared but i feel safe with my dogs and dad also knowing he is just a kid (although a bit older than me) and probably didn’t think what he did was creepy. again thanks all for the support it meant a lot to me. bye :)","NTA- Its super creepy that he followed you, and then waited 2 HOURS to give you ONE dollar.

My girlfriend confronted me in the car ride home for not telling her and I said that it does not concern her and it is not her or my place to know about my parents' finances.

There's a girl (Sara) in my circle of friends that a couple months back spontaneously told me she had a crush on me.

I was taken aback and didn't really sleep that night stressing out about what I was going to do. I like this girl but I barely knew anything about her and I hadn't thought about her romantically up until this point. I was stressed because I just moved across the country to live with my other friends in this same circle and they think this girl and I would be great together. I spend most of the morning and early afternoon agonizing about it. I can't help it. I was thinking about how it would change my life to jump into a new relationship and the dynamic I have with my house mates. It really blindsided me, I was really enjoying myself in this new town and working out again, eating better, trying to change careers. I'm an asshole for making her wait overnight+ a few hours for a text.

My ex fucked me up badly and I let myself fall into a deep slump of self-loathing etc. In retrospect the wrong call but I told Sara I wasn't trying to date anyone right now. And of course I know rejection hurts and I felt like an asshole just for rejecting her it sucks to be rejected, and maybe I'm just letting my anxiety/fear drive my decisions but I didn't feel ready.

My friend(Cathy) didn't understand my reaction at all. ""If a hot person came up to me like that and expressed interest I'd be all over them."" Which I get and I am being too cautious/afraid of another relationship because of my last one(was almost 2 years ago now).

Am I the asshole to expect that group of friends to still include me? I just found out I wasn't invited to a concert/weekend thing that the group is going to. My memory isn't the best but I thought we had all talked about going like I was included. But apparently only they bought tickets. I know rejection sucks and it's embarrassing to be around the person who rejected you for a while but it's been months now and I'm wondering if I'm an asshole for thinking we could still interact in a friend group? Not to mention (it's a small group) we are all going to Japan in May in a few months. I'm definitely invited to that, I was there when we bought tickets. But my other friends failed to mention to the girl that I was going to be coming on that trip the day before we met up to plan/buy tickets. I definitely tried too hard to play it off like nothing had happened the next few times we were all together. In her shoes I wouldn't have wanted me to be weird/ignore her. Should I have apologized again in person? I wouldn't have wanted me to bring it up again from her perspective. My friend that was/is upset with me keeps telling me it can't go back to how it was before and I get that I guess. But then why are we all going to Japan together?
","NTA-

That sucks that they’re not including you now. I’d definitely reach out to someone you feel comfortable talking with and seeing what you can do. That’s really not fair that just because you didn’t reciprocate someone’s feelings you’re suddenly not allowed in the group. 

Is it possible they’re just giving it a cool down period? And maybe after the girl gets over the sting of rejection you’ll be allowed back? ","^^^^AUTOMOD  ***This is a copy of the above post. It is a record of the post as originally written, in case the post is deleted or edited.***

bccmrb,"A year back I had a this girlfriend, she was kinda ok all the relationship stuff but she got bored. I was ok with that and we broke up. The problem now is that our mutual friends and very often we ""have"" to be there. I wouldn't say it's awkward but it is what it is. I didn't like it at all but my best friend wanted me to be there every time (what could I say).

Now let's go in the present, in 3 days I have my birthday party with my brother( not twins just close dates) I wanted to invite some people that **I** feel comfortable with. But here we go... My friends believe that I should invite her to because it would be ""rude"" not to. They said she had done so ""much"" for me. And they gave me an example that she pre-ordered some tickets on the Endgame for me **too**. Although I could have done it on my own either way. My brother doesn't want her too( she never liked her lol) but my friends I will be an asshole if I don't.

a49f4v,"My grandparents left us all a nice sum of money for college. My two older siblings Hollis [29F] and Bradley [25M] used their money to go to school in an expensive city. I chose to stay at home, save the money, and go to a state school. So I still have 2/3 of the money given to me. 

I have always wanted to live in a foreign country. I have been accepted as a TEFL teacher in Japan. I plan to try and stay there if it works out. I have no debt, I am 21, I have a whole lot of adventure waiting for me. 

Before that, I am taking 3K and traveling through Europe. 

Here is the asshole question: My sister Hollis and her husband Billy have a special needs child. Right now he is living at their home, with an aid/nurse coming to see him. There is a full-time home that can take him, but it's going to cost a lot of money. The money they don't have just yet [but might, perhaps, in a few months.] 

They have asked me to loan them the money and they will pay me back in installments. While I am sympathetic to Hollis, it doesn't matter where Huey [9] lives, he is not going to get better. He doesn't do anything for himself and I understand that can be tiring, but he is an infant in a child's body. Even then he mostly just lays, eats, goes to the bathroom, all while in his chair. 

Hollis thinks this home situation will help Huey become more active and heal. Her husband just wants a break from it all. I think they plan to try for another child and want Huey taken care of full time by people who can do it. 

I don't think they will get the money in time. I don't want to give up 10K+ for something I don't view as helpful. If it were going to heal Huey, I would be all for it. But it doesn't matter where Huey is, he is not going to suddenly become a normal nine-year-old boy.

I have declined and my parents are very upset with me. They say my sister will pay me back when she can. But I leave soon and I am not willing to put my life on hold. If they will be getting the money in six months, then the smart thing is to wait until they have it saved and enter the school then. The school is very private and specialized, they say they will take Huey anytime my sister has the cash. 

AITA? ","NTA at all. You were sensible with your money, nobody is entitled to a loan or hand out from their family. 

If they're able to make payments to you they can just as easily take out a loan and make payments to a bank. ","NTA - You chose to spend your money in one way, they chose another, and these are the results. You don't owe them money, particularly because 1) the chances of you getting it back are minuscule, they will just guilt-trip you over and over until you stop asking for it back, and 2) you're right, the home won't help the son, it will probably be helping his parents. It's a very unfortunate situation for your sister but when you choose to have kids, you take the risk that you will end up responsible for a special needs child, and that includes financially.

6yahn8,"so this is a throwaway. background - we're a group of high school girls, all 16/17 and most are seniors. i changed the names.

so last year i was best friends with amanda. like, up each other's ass best friends to the point where we were planning to have a joint graduation party this year. then, this summer i went to an academic summer program and while i was gone, everyone got closer without me. apparently everyone was also annoyed with me talking about my summer program, i really loved the place and the people there and i was excited to share. but no one had told me something was brewing until the day i got back. i was talking to amanda and she was giving me short, one-word responses like ""ok"" to everything. i was so frustrated because i felt like something had been off just like this for the past few weeks, so i went off and asked her what was really up and we got into a huge argument. she then ignored me for days without an answer as to why she was acting this way. 

i went out with our mutual friend, brittany, the day after, and brittany was surprised to know that i had no idea what was going on for the past few weeks. brittany told me that our other friend, sarah, and amanda are now best friends and tell each other everything. including some problems that me and amanda both had with sarah that i had intended to bring up with sarah personally when they happened. 

back in the spring of last year, sarah would talk behind our backs/not tell us things that were going on. one of those things being something really direct and personally harmful to me. i was fed up. i put in the notes app of my phone the things she had done recently that pissed me and amanda off, and i wanted to meet with her about those things and see if we could actually get anything resolved instead of harboring these pissed off feelings behind sarah's back. however, each time we would try to make the plans, something would happen and me and amanda just figured it was a sign and we should let it go. we swore to never talk about it again if we weren't gonna do anything about it, i deleted the notes, and i thought it was over. this was all back in the very end of the last schoolyear. 

amanda told sarah about all of this while i was away at my summer program. she said later that she told sarah this because ""her and sarah were like sisters now and it didn't feel right for sarah not to know how amanda felt last year."" sarah absolutely hated me for wanting to call her out, and i had no idea. sarah literally made plans with me to get ice cream with her later that same day brittany told me all of this. i pulled up to the ice cream shop crying because of everything brittany had told me, sarah called me a psychotic bitch, and i tried explaining that i just didn't want to deal with the dishonesty and pent up anger and apologized for handling things the wrong way but i had long forgotten about all of that, but it didn't help. i later texted her out a longer apology than what i could get out coherently in person, and she responded a few days later that ""we can get past this"" and that was supposed to be the end of that.

i talked to amanda again a few days after meeting with sarah. i had to beg amanda to even speak to me and tell me what happened. we talked at her house, and she said that she would rather be closer friends with sarah now, and she wanted distance. i was like okay, fine, sure, i just want things to be as normal as possible. i still wasn't sure what i did for this to happen, but i know she had the right to make her own choices about who she wanted to be around. 

this was all at the beginning of august, and even though things are ""resolved,"" i feel bullied and excluded by everyone in this group on a daily basis with passive aggressive comments and being intentionally left out of plans. they will all make plans in front of me, with me being the only person left out. amanda is generally just mean to me now, mostly with mock pity - like they all have 5 different guys they're talking to and I don't and whenever it gets brought up, i get the ""aw :("" that i really just feel the superiority through. amanda kept bringing up how my labor day weekend was boring because i didn't have a beach house to go off to like she did.  amanda constantly brags about the places she's going, things she's doing, and boys she's leading on. i feel so so so inferior all the time and i'm tired of hearing about it when i couldn't even talk about my summer program without my friends getting sick of me. today, i was trying to act casual when talking about colleges with this guy she knows i think is cute in our student council group and she made sure to interrupt and ""expose"" me for saying i wanted a chill environment when ""actually Elise (me) is applying to an ivy league."" i got my hair cut around the same time as amanda because everyone gets their hair cut at the beginning of a school year and i changed my hair part because i honestly just wanted to change something about myself, and amanda keeps mocking that ""i just wanna be like her."" amanda will openly bring up the fact that our other friends will talk about me to her, and it seems to always be snide and negative. i don't trust any of my friends and i don't know what to do. i feel sick of it every day. the weirder part is, when me and amanda text a lot, we seem fine and normal, but at school it's completely different and i feel like she's judging me with everything i say and do. i seriously can't make new friends, because it's senior year and it's basically ""established"" that this is my friend group - plus they're in EVERY part of my life, from my classes to my extracurriculars, both of which i'm really involved in. i don't know what to do and i'm scared to stick up for myself because if i start another fight it'll just be an excuse for me to be cut off entirely, and i don't want to go through senior year with no friends at all when i have so many things i want to do - football games, homecoming (i have to go for student council anyway and not having a group bc they all drop me would be hell), halloween stuff, etc. honestly, what did i do? how can i fix this? am i the asshole? 

edit: also should be noted that it seems like sarah still doesn't want to be around me at all, ever, and i don't think that'll ever change - i understand why she would hate me, but i was really hurt by her in the spring when i had planned to confront her.

ed5xx1,"So, my spouse and I got into an argument this evening about autonomy and tattoos. I think that since it’s my body, I get to choose what tattoos/piercings/etc I put on it, especially when they’re non-visible with typical street-clothes. I would understand having a conversation about very visible tattoos if my spouse worked in a more “ traditional” (restrictive) industry, and if I regularly accompanied them to work events. However, neither of those are true — my parter works in a very modern, hip, and accepting industry and I don’t attend their work events often.

My partner believes that, since tattoos are permanent decision and we’re married, that they should be consulted about such a “major life decision.” 

It’s worth noting, I already have a “hidden in work-clothes” tattoo, which I got while we’ve been married. 

Would I, hypothetically, BTA if I got a not-easily-visible tattoo without consulting my spouse?

EDIT: I clarified if saying “hey I want this tattoo I’m going to get it on X date” was enough for my spouse, but they said no — they wanted to be part of the decision-making/approval process.","YTA, but only because of the way this hypothetical is phrased. That art you decide to put on your body is obviously your choice no matter what, but why would you go get a tattoo without telling your life partner? Like this is the one person you've chosen to spend your life with, so why wouldn't you discuss something permanent you're doing to your body beforehand? My husband and I are both heavily tattooed, and though we never ask for ""permission"" to get a new tattoo, we always talk over the idea and the design beforehand to get their opinion on the piece. It seems weird to go behind your life partner's back to permanently alter your body.","

be8nqr,"Went to my grandfather's (mother's father) funeral last Friday in my hometown. When the funeral and everything was done me, my three brothers and our mom decided that we should get together at my oldest brother's house and have dinner and hang out together since it was so long ago that we last met (I live 11 hours away from the hometown and my family almost never meet with each other if I'm not home). Before the dinner me and my younger brother and my five year older brother (M) drive to M:s house to chill out a bit. Me and my younger brother sits down and starts talking about grandpa and memories and stuff that we have of him growing up, while our older brother M is just sitting in a chair with his phone in his hand. During the whole conversation M keeps interrupting just to show pictures of a girl he just met three days earlier and just go on and on about how amazing she is and won't stop talking about her. He then proceeds popping the question if he should bring her to the dinner at my oldest brother's house in a few hours. Both me and my younger brother then tries to convince him that it's probably not the best idea since all of us there probably will be a bit gloomy, especially mom since she just lost her father, but that it would be nice to meet her in another setting. He then tries to convince us that it's a good idea by making some ridiculous arguments but after a while we manage to change his mind.

A few hours later we arrive at our oldest brother's house and his wife and children, our mom and her husband is there also. We have a lovely time even though we just put grandpa in the ground. It was great seeing the family together since it was long ago I last met them. After an hour M whispers to me that he's going to drive and pick up the tinder date and bring her to the dinner. I tell him I think it's a idiotic idea but he's a grown man so he can make his own decisions. This girl then later arrives, fully aware of the situation but still decides to come, when the dinner is ready and we all sit down to eat. She gets seated next to our mother and M. Seeing my mother trying to acquaint with this new girl while holding her tears back, since just loosing her father, made me super furious. I got even more irritated seeing M all cheerio and wanting to make a good impression of our family to new girl by making some shitty jokes and being some kind of an alpha-type character. I continue to get more and more irritated during the dinner but tried not to visibly show my frustration. I replied to questions very short and did not show any interest in chit chatting with neither new girl or M for the rest of the night. I took the early train the next day and now I'm considering about calling M and tell him how I feel about his idiocy.

b9t517,"My sister gets married in a few months. I will be a bridesmaid. A number of weeks ago, she came to me saying she was calling off the wedding, she confessed he was abusive and controlling - for context she listed behaviours such as him mocking her young child, mocking her body, dictating how long she could be away from him for. All the classic symptoms of gaslighting and abuse. She was, mentally, a mess. 

I myself escaped a very abusive relationship in the not-too-distant past. I validated all of her suspicions about her own relationship, knowing she was obviously going to have trouble trusting her gut/her version of reality, but I was very careful not to put words into her mouth. She labelled him, not me. I comforted her, offered her and her son a bed in my home, gave them an escape plan and supported her as best I could. 

Fast forward a week, the wedding is back on. I understand she is a victim, so I was keen not to get angry or disappointed at her going back to him. I've been there, I get it. I expressed that I couldn't unhear what she had said, that I loved and supported her, that I respected her right to make her own decisions - but I could no longer tolerate the man. I explained I would attend her wedding if she wanted me to, I wouldn't ever act untoward or ask her to choose, but that I simply wasn't capable of being anything beyond civil for her benefit. She understood why, given my past. I maintained I would always be there for her. I felt like I was willing to swallow my objections for her benefit so long as she undstood me. 

I tried to be neutral. It became apparent there was still friction on her side. It came to a head when she stated the issue was mine, I was wrong for not wanting to speak to him, I needed to accept him, and insinuated I was exaggerating my own history. Astonishingly, she claimed I shouldn't have believed a one-sided story, even if it was hers... She got very angry at me, we are currently not speaking, and I'm told we won't unless I accept him. I fear I can't but I'm reluctant to address my attendance at the wedding as it seems so very final. 

Am I the asshole for holding onto this?
","NTA, you're looking out for your sister's well-being. Keep supporting her, but I don't think that involves going to the wedding. Maybe you not showing up will be her outlet to talking to more people about this when they ask why you're not there. I hope this turns out for the better for everyone.","NTA at all!!

er6itz,"My boyfriend's friends invited him to a baptism. When we got the invite I said I would not be coming and his response was which dinner option are you picking? So I said none because I'm not coming. He chose -food I don't even really like- and told them I was coming anyway. 

So event day comes up and I'm going because they're nice people and I like them despite not really knowing them at all. Although I feel bad that these people who don't know me and have no idea that I'm not even religious have me coming and are paying for my dinner. Not really important. 
The ceremony (?) happens and everyone is given a cross to wear. My boyfriend says ""I'll put it on for you"" and I said no thank you to which he sighed and goes ""really?! Whatever"" under his breath. 
We get outside and he asks me what did you think? I did try to deflect the question by asking ""about which part"" hoping I could say they had nice outfits or something but he responds about the whole thing.  And all I could really come up with was ""yes, that was a baptism""
At this point hes getting annoyed with me even more and asking things like why wont you just talk to me about it. 

I'm not sure what he expected me to say. He knows I'm not religious and that I actually hate baptisms and don't believe in them on a personal level. We have previously discussed that if he chooses to baptise our kids, i wont be there (ps. He told me I had to). So it isnt news, how I feel on the matter so why ask a question like that when there is no way for me to answer it. If I told him I hated it he would be mad. If I said I liked it he would know I was lying and be mad. I was already annoyed that he tried to make me the bad guy for not wearing a cross so after he started raising his voice at me for not answering his question I was basically done with talking to him. We still had dinner to go and I wasnt going to say anything else and start shit. Then he was annoyed that I looked unhappy and he's saying things like idk what the problem is. So AITA?

We don't live together, and he's was rostered on for 4 days in a row, meaning I couldnt see him until after his 4th shift (distance to his place/work makes visits difficult when he has work).

It wasn't busy so he takes me to a quiet corner of the store (it's massive) and immediately starts saying I'm creepy and asking what I'm doing at his WORK and that it feels like I'm stalking him. Note that I have never done this before and I thought it would be a sweet gesture (which I told him). I've never turned up to where he lives uninvited, but going to his work felt like a sweet thing to do, especially since I havent been before.

We haven't messaged since and I haven't organized to see him after his 4th/final shift of the week yet. Im just really confused because I havent done anything like this before and he hasnt like, told me not to visit his work before. AITA for surprising him? BTW the environment at his work is sooo chill he would definitely not have gotten in trouble for me visiting so I don't think it's that.

**Edit:** I think I just put him on the spot and made him panic, I'm going to call him after his shift and see if I can sort it out. He doesn't normally get mean when anxious. Thanks for the help, everyone. I think everyone just has different 'love languages'.","NTA - that's not normal behavior, you need to talk to him about this","NTA, however, I don’t think your bf’s reaction was as weird or suspicious as some people think it is.

dlj2l5,"Our local rec center offers toddler ballet classes. They have 2 classes for the 2-3 age group. Class A and Class B.


My friend, Suzy, is the teacher for class A. We have kids the same age, they’ve grown up together and are BFFs. 



On the sign up sheet, you can pick which class you want to be in or just let them choose for you. I chose class A but there was a mix up and my daughter got put in class B. 


I wasn’t too concerned and just let it slide but Suzy wasn’t having it. She said she’d fix it so my kid is in class A. 


A week went by and I didn’t hear anything back so i took my daughter to class B which was on Monday. Class A is on tues and thurs 



We get there and they tell me she’s been moved to class A. I ask if she can just stick to class B since we are already here and I’ve arranged my schedule to align with Mon and Wed classes since I never heard back about being moved to class A. They say that’s fine and add my daughter to class B.


Now today comes and Suzy texts me after class is over and asks why my daughter wasn’t there. I tell her that I chose to just stick to Class B. 


She gets really pissed and says that she was making phone calls for days trying to get my daughter in her class. And it’s really rude for me to just go behind her back and switch classes after she put in all that effort.


She also says that our kids were really looking forward to being in class together and it’s mean of me to keep them separate. I responded that it’s probably good for them to have separate classes so they can get better at making new friends. She just said “lol ok”

au0681,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

Okay so I'll give some necessary background information, I'll put an TL;DR at the bottom.

One of my friends is really rich, and the first of us to get married. We'll call her Mia from now on. In our friend group we have 'karen', now Karen has always been a bit defensive and hostile towards Mia. Not enough to have Mia notice this but enough for me to notice.

Mia never made a big deal about being rich, whenever we planned a girls night we would have dinner as places all of us could afford, but she would always cover us if needed. Her gifts for us were always personal, and it took Karen at least a year being in our friend group to discover Mia is rich.

Now upon hearing about Mia's engagement it came to no ones surprise that we would be her bridesmaids. Now I have to say I've known Mia the since high-school so I know that she has been low-key planning her wedding for years. So Mia is going all out, it will be a themed destination wedding. Now before anyone says anything about it being a destination wedding she will pay for anyone's travel expenses, she will also pay for all our custom made dresses.

Now here is the issue were I could the potential a-hole. Karen is one of the bridesmaids and I've heard through some other friends, that aren't invited to the ceremony, they are for the reception that takes place at a later date in our country so more people are able to attend. That Karen is badmouthing Mia to a lot of other friends, saying how she is unreasonable, spoiled and a b-word for wanting her dream wedding apparently. Now Mia has no idea yet, and might throw Karen out of the bridal party if she knows, Mia may be sweet but has a low tolerance for people who are nasty behind her back.

Now of course I don't want Karen to act like this to Mia, I'm not even sure why she is in our close friend group. Although I am not sure if it is my place to tell Mia about this.

So WIBTA if I tell Mia about Karen's behaviour and might get her kicked out of the bridal party.

TL;DR my friend is getting married and generous enough to pay for everything, another bridesmaid is being nasty behind her back and now I want to reveal the truth about her and might get her kicked out of the bridal party.

Edit: I'll talk to Karen first we are all going for drinks later so I get the chance to talk to her. You guys might be right it could indeed be a misunderstanding. I'll keep you guys updated on how it goes.

Update: okay so I made this post a few hours before seeing either Mia or Karen. Now I have a conclusion for the people who are interested. First off Mia knows, no I wasn't the one who told her. It was her fiancé, so apparently Karen uses her Snapchat as her personal diary and put a whole rant about Mia in her story forgetting that Mia's fiancé is friends with her on snap chat, maybe because he never sends her snaps.

So I went to the maid of honours house for girls night, where I find a crying Mia on the couch. You might ask what happened so let me tell you. Apparently Mia's question to Karen about which shade of blue she would prefer set Karen off so badly she went on a whole rant about Mia on her Snapchat story, saying about how awful she is, how the only reason she stays friends is because of a free vacation and all sorts of nasty stuff. Mia's fiancé sees this and tells Mia immediately, because who could blame him, this happened not even that long ago after I made this post. Well the Snapchat story was made in the afternoon the fiancé just saw it in the evening.

Now me, the maid of honour and the other bridesmaids were all hearing Mia out and comforting her, before Karen shows up. Now the maid of honour went off on her, which I can understand being Mia's best friend and discovering how Mia is being used. Karen now being full on thrown out of our friend group, sees this moment as an opportunity to tell us all off. Blaming Mia's fiancé and saying how he had no right to share this, because that's why you posted in on Snapchat I really don't see Karens logic in this but okay.

Now the truth is out in the open, I was fully prepared to talk to Karen first because it could have been a misunderstanding. But I didn't even got the chance to, thanks to everyone telling me to talk to Karen to make sure it weren't just nasty rumours, even though it wasn't necessary in the end I still appreciate it. ","NTA.  Mia is allowed to be rich, allowed to have her wedding wherever and however she pleases.  Covering expenses is incredibly generous.  Fuck Karen.  She’s a jealous bitch, you guys will have more fun without her.","NTA. What you would be is a good friend.

eedfdl,"A long af post and on mobile, so I apologize in advance for any formatting issues! 

I got home from college last week to spend Christmas with my family. All was great, until she told my sister and I a few days later that we needed to bake 4 dozen cookies for coworkers, two types of desserts for a family friend, another dozen cookies for another family friend and two MORE types of desserts for a weekend trip. These needed to be done this coming week or by the end of this week.

It's honestly not a big deal for me to make this, but it was much more than I'm used to doing. What really annoyed me was that after I agreed to do this, my mom didn't say thank you. 

The first dozen cookies I asked my sister to help me, which she obliged, since she was back in town for the break, she wanted to make cookies for her friends she was seeing the next day. She informed my mother of this. When she was packing the cookies my mother got upset that all 36 of the cookies my sister made were not going to the family friend, and asked her to make cookies for her friend next time. My mom made a fuss and my sister ended up having to take a cookie from each of her friend's boxes and putting it in the box we were going to give to the family friend later that day.

My sister had a bad batch of cookies turn out and she's frustrated. My mom sees this and just says ""you don't have to do this anymore. Your sister doesn't have to do this anymore."" and my sister said it's not big deal to which my mom replied ""no just forget about it"" 

I start helping her make dinner. She's supposed to teach me how to make a new dish so I ask her if an ingredient is supposed to be diced up. 

""well it's part of the dish"" 

""so is it supposed to be chopped up? Just tell me and I'll do it for you"" 

""nevermind, just let me do it"" 

""no you can just ask me to do it and I'll do it!"" 

So that turned into a huge fight about the cookies and how my mom shouldn't say please or thank you because I'm her daughter and she doesn't have to say please or thank you. That's reserved for friends/aquaintances only. My mom's argument is that she cooks for us, cleans the house, earns money for the family and I don't say please or thank you. Except I do. After every meal I say thank you and do the dishes. I clean my own bathroom, my sister and I do our own laundry. I tell her but she's so adamant that I'm in the wrong, have a bad attitude and that I should respect her feelings. She started to choke up. I said all I asked her to do was to say a thank you for next time and she yelled at me saying that ""there won't be a next time. You never say thank you."" 
I blew up. I yelled ""I always say thank you wtf is wrong with you!"" and I left the kitchen.

I was sick and tired of feeling like I worked for her and her unapologetic attitude. But I felt bad when I heard her voice choking up and maybe I should have just sucked it up. AITA?","NTA - Your mother had you make over 60 cookies and three different desserts for her to gift to her friends and family (so, semi-professional or nicely finished desserts); and she doesn't think this warrants a thank you because you are related by blood?

So, I have a 5 year old. Blonde hair, blue eyes, freaking adorable little guy. He asked me about a week ago if he could make his hair blue. I said, ""yeah we can do that when you get out of school for summer break."" 

Yesterday, I bought some manic panic for my own hair, and he asked me if I got blue for his hair. I reminded him that school wasn't out yet, and we weren't doing his hair until then. My husband was standing there and asked me what I was talking about. I explained, and he got pissed. He said I was NOT dying our sons hair blue and he wasn't going to have his kid walking around looking like a punk and some other not nice things. He said as his dad, he should have a say in things like that.

The other day my boyfriend took me to his company bbq. It was planned for 2-7pm. This is what we had discussed as I did not want to stay extra time, especially because I do not really know anybody except one or two people.

I am quite the introvert and have to mentally prepare myself for these kind of events I attend with my boyfriend. I already have social anxiety and 5 hours of socializing with people I'm not familiar with was exhausting and was ready to leave and recharge by 7 pm. However my boyfriends coworkers wanted to go to a bar after the bbq later that evening. Since this was a spontaneous idea I didn't want to go as I thought I only had to be out from 2-7pm. 

My boyfriend said that this was a great opportunity to bond with coworkers and a networking opportunity. I already told him I was reluctant to go since I expected to only be out at a certain time. But he and his coworkers kept on pushing for the bar, I did not say I'd go but we ended up driving towards the bar after. While in the car, my social anxiety started to act up since I was not comfortable staying out for extra time and at a bar with people I dont know. In the end I ended up crying and my boyfriend drove us back home.

eqh1wg,"New to reddit so I’m sorry I’m advance for any formatting issues.

First here is some background information. I’m a first year middle school drama teacher (not first year teaching just first for middle school). At the beginning of the year I sent home a syllabus that went over the course and how things would be graded. Since it’s a performing arts course 50% of their grade is based on the final performance. Parents and students had to sign and turn it back in saying they understand. 

Fast forward a few weeks before the final performance I have one student we will call ‘N’ and she says she will not be here for the performance because of a family trip. I tried explaining to her that if this was true I needed a note from home stating this and we could work something out. Every day in class she would say something to me about her trip and I would remind her to bring the note. This went on for about 2-3 weeks. N never brought me a note from home.

So of course she goes on her trip doesn’t come to the performance and gets a 0. This makes her overall grade drop to failing the course. She just returned the other day and asked how she could bring up her grade before report cards and I didn’t have any options for her. Grades were already put into the system and I can’t change anything. I tried explaining to her that I told her many many times to bring me a note and it would’ve been worked out but she failed to do that. 

I thought for sure I wasn’t an asshole in this because of how clear I made it throughout the semester how important this performance was. However my boyfriend thinks I’m a huge AH for this because she’s so young. I get that she’s only in 6th grade and is still very much a child but how else do you teach them to take responsibility for their actions? He says I should’ve reached out to the parents instead of leaving it all up to her

So reddit AITA??

EDIT- I did send home a note to all parents a week before the performance as a reminder with all the details","NTA - By 6th grade the majority of kids are 11/12 years old. If she was able to repeatedly remind you she had a trip coming up, she was definitely able to bring a note from her parents communicating the same.","NAH but as a former teacher, I would have personally contacted the parents on this one, either in person or on the phone, and told them I needed a written note from home so that I could have some backup for adjusting the rules for just one student. 6th grade is still a bit young.

Also, the final performance being 50% of the grade puts you in just this kind of situation. Keep the final to 25% of the grade and you'll be in a better position to keep things fair and cover your own ass.",0,3
chnrkv,"This happened a few years back but watching a few airsoft vids reminded me of this situation that happened. I used to own an Airsoft rifle (Brand: ICS Model: M4) but after not being able to use it (my dad got it for me but due to my low math grades I couldn’t play airsoft), I decided to sell it. 

I posted it on a facebook group I was in and priced it an P10,000 (Philippine pesos), I say in the post that the gun has never been used. A day after I post the gun, I get a few messages from my friends telling me that my gun was only worth around half the price and I should lower it down. I tell them I’m selling it for what I think it’s worth since it’s never been used. They claim that it doesn’t matter since it’s still technically “second hand” and that people are laughing at the price of my gun. I reply, “That’s too bad they can’t afford it. I’m not forcing them to buy a full metal gun. The can go buy somewhere else.”

He replies but just sends a laughing emoji and a “good luck” message to me. 

A week later, I do sell the gun for P8000 to this guy (he also played airsoft and seemed knowledgeable ). After the sale, I message my “friends” saying I sold it already for P8000. They were pretty much mad because I should’ve lowered the price and I pretty much scammed the guy. I tell them whatever  

Now that I’m looking back into the situation? Was I TA for selling it at a higher price than what it was really worth?","NTA. This is called good business. It's not like you were pressuring the buyer into buying from you, he was free to do price comparisons of his own.","

brvoy1,"So my wife and I just got back from out honeymoon, and we were opening presents and cards, and we both kinda feel like we didn't get a whole lot. Now I know I should be grateful for whatever I get, because anything is awesome really, but in total, I think we got maybe like 10 actual presents, and like 25 cards. We likely at least 180-200 people show up. Am I just being selfish or did we just not get a lot of presents?

Edit: While yes, she did have three bridal showers, they were all quite small with 10 people or so, with one have only three people at it. We are not, however, upset with anyone that came to the showers and the wedding and got a present for either one or both. We are both very grateful to them, and honestly everyone that came and wished us the best. Just a little confused as to the surprisingly small amount of gifts. Lacking mostly from my family it would seem. We don't plan on confronting anybody about it though, as that would very much be crossing the line.

b5cj07,"As a hobby, my GF and I regularly dance West Coast Swing (obligatory plug - it's a lot of fun and super awesome). The culture is very low-key and casual. Anybody can ask anybody to dance, and it's expected you not refuse unless there's a reason (i.e. I'm taking a break, or I'm about to leave, need to go to the bathroom, etc). In my area there is usually several opportunities a week to go out dancing, which is pretty nice.

&amp;#x200B;

GF has a close friend who also comes out regularly - chubby, and has been losing weight due to her dancing. Due to her newfound confidence in her body image, she's been gradually wearing less when going out. At this current point, standard outfit is a bra covered with a kind of lace see-through non-shirt outer-shirt (you know, the kinds that don't actually cover anything - that people wear over tank tops, etc).

c8szpt,"So to preface this, my mom is extremely conservative. She had me (19F) out of wedlock and my biological father is a POS, but since then, she hasn't really taught me anything about sex except for that I shouldn't do it until I'm married (I was homeschooled so had no way to really learn). When I was 10 and curious, she handed me an Amish book to try and explain it and it was extremely vague, so she HAD to give me the talk. 

Like I said, my mom taught me nothing except that it's meant for marriage. I didn't know what a condom was until I was 15. I obviously didn't listen and slept with my now fiance about three months before my 18th birthday. She flipped her shit and it was awful and led to me moving in with my fiance before I turned 18.

My sister (14) has a LDR, and since I've moved out, every now and then when I'm alone with her, I talk to her about safe sex, birth control, and that if she does choose to have sex before marriage, it is her choice, not my mom's. I have told her that she definitely should wait until she's a lot older, but that if she does choose to make her own choices, she can always come to me for anything of the sort and that she doesn't always have to live by my mom's standards. 

My mom does know that I talk to her about this stuff, and she always gets upset when it's brought up, saying that it's not my place and that my sister should be coming to her for that stuff as well as reiterating that sex isn't supposed to happen outside of marriage. My sister has spoken up and said ""well, you don't really talk to me about that stuff,"" to which she always replies with ""well you can."" The thing is though, my mom is never educating my siblings on safe sex and expects all 4 of my siblings to wait until marriage. I have told her it's extremely unrealistic and they're going to make their own choices regarding their sex lives in the future. She just doesn't listen, which is why I talk to my sister about this stuff. 

So am I the asshole for pulling my sister aside occasionally to educate her on safe sex?","NTA. You are doing her a service, thanks for looking out for them.",NTA sex education is important.

blc666,"So I’ve been a vegetarian for 14 years, but I don’t care whether anyone else is or not as that was my personal choice that I’ve made for my own reasons and I’ve never tried to force someone else to stop eating meat. When I still lived at home I was the only person in my family who was vegetarian which meant that all pots, pans, plates, etc. were cross contaminated. 

There wasn’t much I could do about it, so I just went with it and was grateful to be living at home saving money. The only real downside is that if someone had used a pot or dish and hadn’t gotten the chance to wash it I would occasionally have to scrub the remainders of whatever meaty meal they had cooked, which did gross me out but because I was using my parents’ cookware I never complained.

When I moved out, I got an apartment with some close friends who are all vegan and as a housewarming present my grandparents gave me a really nice set of pots and pans which my roommates and I all share. Because none of my current roommates eat any animal products, none of my pots and pans have ever had meat products in them, which I’ve come to prefer as it feels “cleaner” to me and limits the chances of me accidentally consuming meat at home.

My roommates and I have been living together for three years, but in a few months we’ll all be moving on and I will be getting a new place with a longtime friend who happens to eat meat. I don’t care that he eats meat and would never try to change him, but would I be the asshole if I explain that while my pots and pans are for household use, I don’t feel comfortable having meat cooked in them?

Edit: I just wanted to address some points that have come up a lot in the comments -

1) He IS allowed to use my cookware, I just don’t want meat cooked in them.

2) I don’t want and would never ask him to purchase a full set of cookware, my suggestion will be that he supplies a few separate skillets, pans, etc that he can cook meat in.

3) I didn’t elaborate on this point in the OP as the internet can be pretty harsh towards vegetarians, but in addition to wanting to avoid any meat chunks or residue in my pots and pans, the thought of cooking my vegetables in the same skillet that just had hamburger washed out of it grosses me out. It’s a mental hang up of mine, but it’s there.

4) A few people in the comments asked about other utensils, bowls, etc. I don’t have an issue sharing non-porous items such as plates and utensils, but my porous cookware is a different story. I also plan to have him buy a cutting board that he can use for meat as it’s not a good idea to chop produce on the same surface as raw meat.

5) I’ll update the post later this evening (pacific time) after I speak with him over dinner.

Thanks for all of the feedback and comments, guys! I appreciate it ~

UPDATE:

So I just came back from dinner with him and mentioned my thoughts about cookware and he said “That’s fine, I have a skillet I was planning to bring that I can use for meat.”

Thanks again for all of the feedback!","NAH* they’re your pans, they’re not expensive. They’d be able to buy themselves a pan if they wanna cook meat in it.

diy32q,"Pretty simple. Went to the grocery store with a friend (21m) of mine (22f) during lunch break. He picked a bar of chocolate and bread. At the register, he only paid for the bread and hid the chocolate on the other hand. I did not saw him doing this, I just thought it was weird he only paying for the bread but I figured he must have decided not to buy the chocolate. While walking out I saw him with the chocolate in his other and he even had the audacity to offer me some. It bothered me a lot but I pretended I didn't notice and that was it.

This happened last week.  I couldn't even hold a proper conversation with him ever since. If he had been caught I was with him and could've serious problems, or just the embarrassment of passing as a shoplifter when I'm not, especially in a store I usually frequent. I'm literally disgusted by him, I feel that I'm maybe overreacting, but I literally cannot even look him in the eyes. He has noticed and asked if I was okay, I just said I've had a few bad days.

Do you think I would be the asshole if I ignored him completely from now on or saying that I dont want to have anything to do with him? He is always trying to spend the lunch hour with me, today I just left work in the afternoon because I didn't want to be near him.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT -  IT IS NOT ABOUT THE CHOCOLATE its the way he was comfortable doing it, and that he felt ok doing that while I was with him is concerning. What kind of person does that? The way he stole it, and how he behaved before during and after is definitely telling about him and his shoplifting habits (and other moral ideals that may come with it). If i was to steal something I would be all nervous. He did it in the most natural and smooth way.","NTA. My ex admitted to shoplifting on several occasions, almost bragging about it. One of many reasons I ended it. We still chat here and there but nothing meaningful.","NTA/INFO

Is your friend in a struggling situation financially? Did he already have a chocolate bar? You didn't get to see much so maybe you could try confront him about it?

cchq8m,"A little background: I (M26) am the second oldest out of 4 siblings. My mom and dad divorced my junior year of high school, 12 or so years ago. During that time mine and my siblings relationship with my dad has been dysfunctional at best. He’s an alcoholic and when my parent first got divorced he would have us over at his place every 2 weeks. His drinking would always get the best of him and he would write us off every two years or so only for us to try and reconcile the relationship and him to write us off again. When I turned 21 I thought I’d give it another shot with him only for him to write me off again. After that last time I just said “fuck it” if he wants a relationship with me he’ll be the one to reach out. 
Flash forward to now; nothing but radio silence since for me. My older sister (F28) talks with him as well, she lives on her own with her 2 kids. My younger sister (F21) lives with him but she is always complaining about him. My youngest sister (F19) took the same approach as me and decided to cut ties with him altogether. But it’s essentially the same thing with my younger sister, my dad will get drunk and end up getting in an argument and kick her out or threaten to kick her out. My oldest sister has similar issues in that my dad will call her up cussing and saying he wants nothing to do with her, only for her to try and reconcile a few days later. 
Yesterday my sister and I were talking and she said, “I have to take dad to the hospital so they can biopsy a mass on his kidney, the doctors are pretty sure it’s cancer.” Truthfully, I felt nothing. Not sorry for him in the slightest, and not even feeling like he deserved it, just nothing. 
I’m hoping it’s not cancer but at the same time if it is would I be the asshole if I didn’t seek out talking to him?","NTA. You don’t owe him a thing. You, and your emotional wellbeing &gt; your abusive father. Also, happy cake day!","

cv24v6,"A bit of scene setting before I get to the point. My wife and I both work full time. We have two sons, 12 and 10. Two weeks ago we got two puppies. Things are hectic. 

As the end of the summer nears and my son’s friends return from various summer trips, my son asked my wife and me for a sleepover this coming Wednesday. Wife deferred to me and I said no. 

See, my wife is working late on Wednesday. I am working normal hours meaning I’ll be home around 5;30. We have a nanny but she expects to leave around the time I get home. Kids would already be at our house when I arrive. So I’d be in charge of 5 kids and two puppies until my wife got home (earliest 7 PM but almost certainly more like 8 or later). Even for a couple hours it’s a two-parent thing or chaos will take over. 

So as soon as I say no, my wife and son start bargaining with me about why it should be fine to do Wednesday, it’s not that big of a deal. Ends with my wife saying “you’d can’t just be a parent for one night?” implying, of course, that I’m not any other nights. This is important because to me, my decision was made in the name of good parenting. They can have the sleepover another night. 

So anyway, now my son thinks I’m an asshole, my wife only wants my opinion when it agrees with hers. The ways they’re both treating me ha me wondering if I’m TA here. Am I?","YTA - If you can’t handle a few kids and your dogs without your wife’s help, you shouldn’t have had kids or got dogs.

arm9vf,"This should be short. My boyfriend (now husband) and I spontaneously decided to get married on Friday. He was working near the courthouse and he asked if I wanted to meet him there and that was that. We were technically engaged already but had never made any wedding plans and had really never brought it up again besides telling people that we were engaged. 

Now I’m my parents only child. My dad has two stepchildren from his marriage to my stepmom and they were at both of their weddings but my I’m my moms only child and my stepdad doesn’t have children. Am I the asshole for getting married without telling them first? Also I still haven’t told them because I’m afraid that they’ll think I’m an asshole for not telling them beforehand. 

TL;DR I got married without telling my parents. Am I an asshole? ","NAH But as an adult, sometimes you make decisions you decide are right for you despite the way others aren't going to like it, and you have to own that. So, yeah, maybe your family will feel hurt, and you took that into consideration when you eloped and decided you were okay with that, so it's time to live with that choice. But it was your choice to make. Congrats on getting married, by the way.","NTA. I did the same thing. 

My husband and I are planning to have a big wedding one day, as our families are pretty traditional and religious. We can’t afford that right now with our student loans, so we’re waiting to tell our parents until we’re comfortable financially. 

I think my parents would be upset if they found out, but I’m not hiding it from them forever. They have certain ideas about marriage that are different from ours, and while we want to respect their ideas, we love each other deeply and made this decision for ourselves. I think that is completely okay. 

If you’re not planning to have a traditional wedding, maybe have a small celebration where you can include your parents. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy, it could be just a small dinner at a nice restaurant. It would make them feel more included and be a nice gesture. ",3,0
cxje0j,"Basically the title.

I ordered food late last night, and the guy that delivered it stayed outside of my house while texting/calling me. I ended up having to call the police because he wouldn't leave me alone.

I tried calling my boyfriend (after calling the police, don't worry) and he didn't answer. He called me back and when I told him what happened he said ""and then what...?"" which made me feel like shit so I just said we'll talk in the morning.

I told him what happened via text this morning and he asks me of the guy's race... like what? Why the fuck does that matter. It's just unbelievable to me that that question is even on his mind? Like I wouldn't give a fuck if he's a purple people eater, he now has my address and doesn't take no for an answer.

I'm asking AITA because maybe I'm just wrapped up in the moment and there's a reason that his race matters that I'm not thinking about.

Edit: He apologized for seeming insensitive and I apologized for getting so worked up. I filed a police report and let my building manager know in case he seems him. Thanks all for the different perspectives.

Second edit: To the people telling me I'm trying to be ""woke"", I'm not. He only asked about race and no other descriptors. I'm not stupid, colorblind, or white for that matter.","YTA 

Sorry, but I think your bf just wanted a description just in case he saw him or you saw him again.

epu22q,"I (28M) love hiking and live in a city about an hour drive from a really great national park. I have been with my girlfriend for almost a year. During our entire relationship I have gone hill walking at least one weekend a month, as well as a week-long trip to the alps to do a short trek. I have been doing this sort of stuff since I was 18 and I really know what I'm doing. I have been on a few courses learning navigation and other skills (including winter walking for when there is snow) and am hoping to be able to be a guide at some point.

My girlfriend has come with me quite a few times, but I normally go alone or sometimes with friends. She is always welcome to come but she doesn't enjoy it as much as me.

When I told my girlfriend about my plans she freaked out. She called me irresponsible and crazy for going to the Himalayas where there are even more dangers than where we live. She says she wouldn't be able to cope with me being gone for that long without her being able to contact me for a lot of it (I probably won't have internet/signal for most or all of the trek). I have told her she could come as well, but she doesn't want to. I feel like if I go on this trip it will be the end of our relationship because she is really upset about it.

9pp04w,"Some backstory: My husband and I have been together for 7 years. We have been married for 4 (this November). He is a product of in vitro fertilization. I have hated children my entire life and have been vocal about it long before I met my husband. When I discussed children with my husband he made it very clear he never wants kids and has even considered a vasectomy. Now that you know all that here is why I’m apparently the asshole. His mother has made it very clear that we are horrible for not wanting kids. She has used her own issues getting pregnant, religion, crying, guilt, and constant pressure to try and change our minds. The three of us went to a mall one day and we saw a screaming child. Me and my husband laughed and thanked god we weren’t that parent because we know that dealing with an upset kid can’t be fun. She burst into tears and said things like “I can’t believe I raised a son who doesn’t want kids” and “you two should be more sensitive since not everyone can get pregnant!” And then she walked away from this. As a side note I have never had fertility testing done so I’m not even sure I can have children. Especially because I have PCOS and I’ve been told that can cause issues with fertilization. (Note that I haven’t looked into if it actually does cause issues because I am not trying to have kids) So. Am I the asshole for voicing my opinion about my own body? I feel like I should be allowed to respond to her when she asks if we are ready to have kids. When she asks I just say “no, we don’t want them”. I don’t pitch a fit. I don’t say it in a snarky tone. I just say it so she knows our stance has not changed and won’t. Thoughts?

bnctd5,"So I go to a pretty small private school with about 60 sophomores (we just finished sophomore year, juniors next year). Our last day was Thursday, with final exams up until that point. So I had a end-of-the-year party at my house. I basically sent out a mass text a week before telling everyone in the sophomore class where my house is in case they haven't come before, what time, etc, etc. I get along with basically everyone in my grade, which is why I invited everyone. The one exception is this one guy, let's call him Andy, who I don't like. He's obnoxious, and thinks and acts likes he's super cool and popular but isn't. You get the idea. So I didn't invite him. He asked me in class on Wednesday if I forgot to send him his text. I just told him sorry, he wasn't invited. He got pissed off for not being invited when the whole rest of the sophomore class was. I just told him I have no obligation to invite him if I don't want. 

He looked angry and just walked away, and I thought that was that. While the party was still going yesterday, I realized he had sent me q bunch of angry texts on snapchat. Basically, he saw stories I had posted with pics or videos of the party, and he saw those, swiped up, and sent me a barrage of texts talking about how it's unfair he was the only kid who wasn't invited. I just replied, 'doing shit like this is the reason nobody likes you in the first place'.

awaqk6,"My parents have always had a bad relationship, to the point that they can’t have a conversation without getting mad at each other. They make each other miserable. My dad probably shouldn’t have gotten married in the first place and seems to do better alone. My mom and I have tried to convince him to see a marriage counselor and he refuses, but he also doesn’t make an effort when we try and talk to him about problems we have with him. It’s like you can tell he doesn’t care and is just waiting for you to stop talking.

I’ve suspected my mom might be cheating on my dad since I was in middle school, when I accidentally found love letter addressed to her. This was confirmed years later when she was being shifty about some “work thing” and confessed to me that she was actually meeting a man, and that it wasn’t her first time doing something like this. She didn’t say it, but based on the letter and some things I noticed over the years, I inferred that it had been going on for basically my entire life. I hate to say it, but I was relieved to find this out; I thought it meant my parents might divorce. Well, apparently not. My mom told me she wasn’t planning on leaving my dad, basically just because it would be difficult for her (having to move out, her not having as much disposable income via him, figuring out where I‘d go, etc.) It seems like she just wants the best of both worlds (my father’s money with fulfilling relationships on the side.) 

As an only child, I’m stuck in the middle while they take out their frustrations about the other on me. I really try to be understanding—my mother’s previous marriage was abusive, so it’s no wonder she’s settled, and my father definitely has some sort of undiagnosed issue that makes any kind of relationship difficult for him, but it’s hard. I’ve tried to talk to them both but it doesn’t work. My dad insists they still love each other, and my mom acts like nothing can be done.

I don’t want this to continue for the rest of their lives, and I don’t want to keep my mom’s adultery a secret from my dad because that isn’t fair to him. I’m 18 now and while I won’t be moving out for awhile, I thought of a plan for when I do. I know my mom’s phone password, and would easily be able to get evidence of what she’s been doing to give to my dad. I know this is a breach of privacy, but I’m scared that without something tangible and recent, they’ll just be able to sweep it under the rug and go back to their normal lives. I’ve even thought of telling them when I leave that I can’t be in their lives until they take some sort of action themselves because I’ve always had to be the one in the middle, the rock. I love them and just want them to try and better their lives because it feels like they gave up, and while the last thing I want to do is hurt anyone it doesn’t seem like talking to them makes a difference. ","YWBTA unfortunately, it is a breach of privacy and your mother will likely never forgive you. Also it's a bad idea because you reaaaallly don't want to be in the middle of a marital dispute. Truly. The best thing you can do for yourself is to go to therapy to better express how their behavior negatively affects you. Do what you can for yourself, and advocate for yourself as much as you can - but don't violate your mother's trust and expect her to thank you for it later.","YTA. Or YWBTA. Whatever.

artuyk,"I'll try to keep this as succinct as possible without leaving out any relevant details and hopefully not in a biased way. Anyway: 

Lately I've been interacting a lot with a guy who has been making me very uncomfortable, but it's hard to tell if he's malicious or just overly friendly, and if I'm not imagining things. I usually pass by his house on my way to class, and a few weeks ago he was getting his mail when I walked by and said hello. Nothing out of the ordinary; I said hi back and that was it. This happened a couple more times that week, but again I didn't see it as abnormal.

The next week he showed up during my shift at the coffee shop I work at. Not weird in itself, but conversing with him I was getting kind of an odd vibe from the guy. *Slightly* creepy. Plus the fact that he'd never been in there before weirded me out. He came in again a few more times that week and the week after, sort of developing a routine of coming in on my shift. At that point I was starting to get a bit more concerned, because it seemed like he was actually trying to see me as much as possible, but even then I figured it could be fairly innocuous. Or at worst, he was interested in me, and I could just turn him down. But still, no huge cause for alarm I guess. 

I didn't see him at work or on my way to/from class at all the next week, so I kinda thought the whole thing was over. But it wasn't, because three times that week I spotted his car in very weird places; once in the parking lot outside the building I had class in, and outside the school library, and once driving through an intersection that I was walking a block away from. 

So I was feeling somewhat freaked out about this when he eventually did come for coffee at my work again. I initially avoided him, but then I straight up told him (in as discreet a way as possible) that his attention was making me uncomfortable, that I'd seen his car in weird spots, and that I felt like he was stalking me. Yes, I actually used that word. He did not react well to being accused of that, said he was just being friendly, and basically called me crazy and made a huge scene, and stormed out. 

Does it sound like I'm being crazy? AITA for jumping to conclusions, or do I have reason to be concerned?

evabws,"Hey guys, I posted on here like two days ago and it got deleted but I have some updates on this story. So my mom told me about three weeks ago that she and her boyfriend planned a weeklong trip to Cali pretty much out of the blue and told me they needed to sleep at my apartment and have me drop them off at the airport (I live about 20-30 minutes away) at 4 AM.

I told her this wouldn’t work but she was more than welcome to come over and sleep here since her car is here, so she wouldn’t have to drive home super early.

So me (25f) and BF(25M) have been together a little over two years. We have some bad history and have been working through a small infidelity from a year and a half ago.

byufi7,"Not sure how to add flair for a NSFW warning, but here it is.

So my girlfriend and I are sexually active and plan on having a future together, plan on going to college, kids, owning a house. The whole nine yards. 

Well, to make some extra money for college since I'll be starting soon, one of my coworkers recommended becoming a sperm donor. He donates too, and it helps him make his payments each month for his house, his car, etc.

I brought this idea to my GF thinking she'd be excited I'm going to be able to afford college just a little easier and not be in debt AS badly. 

She completely shut me down, saying it's not her having the kids and would prefer me to wait until we have kids to donate.

I'm extremely confused and slightly annoyed because I'm just trying to keep myself out of as much debt as possible, but my GF is making it out as if I'm cheating on her indirectly by donating to a sperm bank.

So AITA here? My point if view is. 1. I'm never gonna know the baby/ parents of baby because I'm pretty that stuff is anonymous 2. It's not like I'm having sex with anyone that uses my sperm, it goes into this vial as I have read and its stored.

If I could get a females opinion I'd appreciate it because I'm really not able to see my GF's point very well

EDIT: So someone mentioned a valid point that made me think.
IF and I'm saying IF I followed through and donated, would I lie to her? Well obviously not? That's a huge decision for me and it would eat me alive if i didn't tell her. 

Someone did PM a perspective I hadn't thought of, and admittedly they are right, it would potentially cause a lot more problems in the future than what the money would be worth. So in short, I'll just stick in investing in the stock market. I appreciate the outside opinions here

EDIT 2: So, if I didn't make myself clear

1. I haven't gone through and donated, I merely talked with a coworker that suggested it, then did some online research but not a whole lot before bringing it up with my GF

2. Everyone who thinks I'm lying to her, if I wanted to, I wouldve already found out how to sign up

EDIT 3: Alright, 3 edits in less than an hour but I see why. This is a very serious topic for my current and maybe future relationships. After reading everyone's comments and being informed of the repercussions, I'm gonna make the sensible choice and not donate sperm. As everyone has said, it could lead to heartbreaks later down the road I don't want. Thank you everyone who has responded","YTA 
She didn't shut you down, she established a boundary with you. People exist in and out of debt without donating sperm. Also, make sure you do your research before going through with it, most places have a system in place for the children to have your contact info when they're 18 (may be optional, not a dude so I haven't come across it). Anyway, you can choose to have trust in your relationship or you can donate your sperm immediately--you don't get to have both.",LMAO. Isn't this the plot to an episode of *That 70's Show*?,1,3
dfbrhc,"A bit of back story. I've just moved into college housing along with my roommate. We've both moved in at the same time and are freshmen with the same major. The housing we share is an old motel redone for the students. The room is a studio with just the two of us living here.   
Saturday after having had been in the apartment for a few weeks my stuff from home arrived. The only things this post will pertain to are my TV and PS4. So the apartment came furnished with beds, a TV, a kitchen table, and etc. When my stuff arrived I immediately began setting up my TV which is a 65"" 4k smart compared to the 24"" that was here when we moved in. There was a wooden coffee table that was here when we moved in, but since we never used it we put it in a storage closet. Well, I dug it out and pulled it to my side of the room and set my TV and console on it.  
Monday I had classes in the morning and my roommate later in the day. When I come back I find that the table with my game and TV has been moved to the center of the room in front of the couch and my roommate and a friend of his are playing on my game and this is how the conversation goes. It was just between my roommate and me as his friend didn't say anything.  
Me: Umm....what are you doing. R: Playing Mortal Kombat. Me: I can see that. I mean why did you move my stuff. R: I figured this would be better. What's the big deal? Me: The deal is that MY TV and PS4 and you didn't even ask me to use them let alone move them. R: We wanted to play a game besides your TV is bigger that one so it's only fair to share it. Me: NO! They both are mine! If I want to put them on my side of the room I will. Don't touch my shit unless I say it's okay. R: Fuck off dude. It's on the coffee table and you don't own it.  
At that point I just get pissed and unplug the game and tell him to never touch my stuff and moved it back. Skipping forward to today he comes home and goes into the kitchen and pulls out a knife set he bought which I thought was odd because I had already bought one so I ask about it.  
Me: What's that for? R: Oh I just don't want to touch YOUR SHIT without permission. Me: Petty much? (I just roll my eyes and go back to what I was doing.) R: No you're just a dick.  
So I'm curious was I in the wrong here or was he?

Edit: Let me clarify a few things. The 24"" that was furnished with the apartment is still hanging on the wall and connected to the cable. My tv was next to my bed on my side of the room. Where my roommate moved it to was in the middle of the apartment at least 15 feet from where I left it and my games weren't unpacked when I left so I knew he went through the boxes under my bed when I came back.","ESH- Dude, you are in for a rough semester","

d8y12w,"I’m married and have several children. Youngest are 2 and 3 and oldest is a teen and 10 years old. The work I do is mentally, emotionally and physically exhausting. Wife is primarily a stay at home mom which I know is hard work in and of itself. This is not the first time we have gotten into fights over stuff like this. So, AITAH?

Edit: I work as a registered nurse on medical surgical and telemetry. The demands on my time are to total strangers that are at times very sick. I wipe complete strangers asses multiple times per day and I have told my wife that on any given day I probably change more diapers and wipe more behinds than she does. And it’s not cute little baby bottoms that we created. It’s the elderly, the trauma patient, the demented patient, the mentally ill and so on.

I’m also not referring to every night after a 12 hour shift. I’m talking about nights where I’ve pulled off a string of them. That’s what exhausts me. If you catch me after the first few I’m fine for the most part. I’ll help with baths and bed time. I’ll read the kids a book. I’ll help with homework if mom didn’t have the time. I do these things willingly and with a smile because they are my kids too. My wife doesn’t have to ask me to do the dishes because I just do it. That’s why when crap like this happens (no pun intended) it throws me for a fkn loop.  

Also some have asked if she works. She has a small business that she has had going on 7 years. I’m proud of her and what she is able to do and accomplish with so much on her plate. It makes her happy. When she comes home after being on her feet for 6-9 hours she acts as if she’s dying and immediately heads for the bed room (migraines) and I never give her tasks or chores to do I just let her be.

evy7kn,"My roommate [22F] and I [22F] have been living together in an apartment for about a year, but we've been friends for 3. We lived in a dorm together freshman year, and had no issues. 

When I moved out of my old apartment last year, my old roommate gave me her toaster oven because she moved back home and didn't need it. I took it, because I figured it could be useful. I don't use it super often, but my old roommate did, and although she cleaned it a bit, it was a little grimy when I got it. After another semester of use by my current roommate, it was fairly gross. She tried cleaning it recently, and it's a little better now but not much, and definitely worse than when I got it. 

My roommate is convinced that we have to throw it out and it's ruined. It still works, and the rack is clean, the rest is just greasy. I don't care if she wants to get rid of the toaster oven - I got it for free, and I use it maybe once every few months. However, she wants me to buy a new one. I really don't see this as my responsibility, and I definitely can't afford a new one right now which I've told her. I told her that I probably wouldn't have bought one for the apartment anyways, and the only reason we have this one is because I got it for free, but if she wanted a new one I was fine with throwing this one out. She got really mad at me, and said that it was something I had contributed to the kitchen, so I needed to replace it. If it was my Crock-Pot or something I used regularly, I would. Even if it was actually broken I would be more willing to, but right now I can barely afford groceries let alone replacing a toaster oven that is still functional. 

The other day, she told me that she had talked to her mom about it, and her mom had agreed that it was my responsibility to replace it. Now I'm wondering if I'm in the wrong and being a jerk by not getting a new one. 

Tldr: I was given an old toaster oven before moving into my current apartment, but I hardly ever use it. My roommate is convinced that it's too dirty to use, and wants me to buy a new one. She's really mad at me because I'm refusing. AITA?","This is the stupidest thing I've heard. NTA.

et7vrr,"So recently for context, I've had trouble finding work due to my condition (Epilepsy) I'm unable to do EXTREMELY fast paced work (Fast food, warehouse work, etc). So it's been a trying time for me. My Mother allowed me to stay with her and her boyfriend just until I can get on my feet. 

So 3 months into the stay, I've had 2 jobs, none I could keep and have been holding down minimal work doing video editing for people. I've been paying her (although not huge amounts).

So 3 days ago, she comes home late and drunk with her boyfriend and my 2 other younger siblings in the car. I ask how everything went and she tells me I have until tomorrow afternoon to leave. I at first say ""Are you sure, let's talk about it more tomorrow."" And the annoying bf loud mouth gets in my face and says ""SHE'S SURE!! WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH YOUR SHIT ANYMORE!"" 

Next day comes and my stuff is outside. I try to talk to her but I can't say anything without her asking her bf. She's become so dependent on this guy she can't even make a decision on a meal, what pill she should take, and how much (and I'm not exaggerating this I SWEAR TO GOD, I SWEAR) how many breaths of air to breathe in a minute. 

I ask her if she can let me sleep in her car for the night in exchange for $10. She tells me ""NO! YOU ARE 19, YOU'RE AN ADULT, YOU CAN FIGURE YOUR OWN SHIT OUT!""

So I've spent the last day or two looking for homeless shelters in my city, and any resources for homeless people, none for Men. All for women. I slept on a park bench last night in the pouring rain. So morning comes, I knock on her door and ask to take a shower. She asks her bf On speakerphone if I can, and he says ""if it's over 10 minutes, call the police"" So I quickly shower and I start the dreaded argument with my mother.

So I told her this during the argument ""You would really let your own son, freeze out in the cold rather than let me wait just until I get my tax return (already filed) and get out""

Then she said the words that sent me into rampage ""If you die, that's your fault, I am not going to help you with your problems"" I spent the next 20 minutes cussing her out until she broke down crying.

She attempted to call the police on me for cussing her out, in her words ""Abusive behavior"" After they found me, they brought me back and assessed the situation and told me to go so everything could calm down. I asked if there were any resources for homeless people and they told me ""No.""


My mother has gone on to lambast me to other family members over social media and has essentially ruined most of my relationships with family under the guided lies and puppetry of her bf. Ever since she's been with this deadbeat loser, she's hasnt been much of a mother to me or my little brother, she just does what her manipulating, drunk Bf says. She listens to his drunk friends who lie about literally everything and has become nothing but a puppet.

cqf8dv,"I'm on mobile.

So my (28f) fiancé (29m) thinks I was being an asshole ( more like a Karen) in this situation. I do not.

Background info, I work as a bartender so I know full well how to stay polite and ask for stuff nicely. 

I went to Starbucks the other day and ordered a frozen cappuccino with an extra shot of espresso in it. I was one of the only clients in the place along with my 2 friends, so the baristas were not busy making orders.

I saw that the barista used a blender, made the iced cappuccino mix, poured the extra espresso shot in the blender and pour the drink in the cup, handing it to me. The thing is, she had overshot her quantities and threw half of that mix out. This means half of my extra shot of espresso that I paid for went down the drain. Having known this is how she made it, and wasted some of it, I would have order that shot on the side.

So, as nicely as I could ( my service tone) I said that I was sorry to ask, but would it be possible to get the full shot that I had ordered, since I ordered it because I was sleepy and I had paid for it. The employee looked at me like I was crazy, so I said that I was sorry for the trouble but I really wanted that shot. 

She looked really irritated and asked the manager if she could make another espresso shot. To which the manager obviously said yes. As she gave it to me though, she was very dismissive and just pushed it over. Even with her attitude, I thanked her and told her I appreciated. 

I'm 100% sure my tone, my smile, and the way I asked was not condescending at all, as I try to be overly nice to customer service employees.

My fiancé is not the one to ask for something to be replaced when it's not what he ordered, but I am. I know it's a hassle for employees but I much prefer my own customers tell me something is off right off the bat so I can fix it.

So, was I a Karen in this situation or is he being dramatic because it makes Him uncomfortable to ask?

Edit: wording because it was a confusing sentence.

I accept both judgements ( for maybe having sounded condescending to her) and I will try to word stuff better in the futur.

Second edit: some people are confused as to why I'm calling it an ice cap. Here in Canada, we have Tim Hortons ( which I usually go to), and they have ice caps. As this situation happened almost 2 months ago, I just forgot what they were called at Starbucks. I did explain what I wanted and ordered it by its Starbucks name equivalent at that moment.

Also, I'm francophone so I do confuse word meanings sometimes. By ""overly nice"" I didn't mean like a cartoon caricature type. I meant I'm really careful of being super friendly and courteous, if that helps.

I've had a bunch of tips given to me on how to order from Starbucks properly. Thank you kind baristas.","You didn't get a free coffee, you got what you ordered when they made a mistake. NTA.","NTA, a regular cafe wouldn't even think twice about that they would fully understand.",0,0

now I work in the States I have this one co-worker who constantly calls me English, and I have had to constantly remind her that I am British, not English (I identify as British over Scottish but her calling me Scottish would be fine too, but she never does) 

&amp;#x200B;

examples of her calling me this include  

""give us some of that good English humour of yours""  

""does your Wife find it weird being married to an englishman""  

""do you think you'll ever stop being english and being american instead?""  

""why are you English so bad at food""  

"" (during a coffee run) do you want a Tea, since you're english""

&amp;#x200B;

throughout all of these examples and more I have frequently informed her that I am British, not English and that her calling me English is like me calling her a Californian (shes Texan) but she doesn't listen and has said that ""your country is too confusing"" 

&amp;#x200B;

so today we were all talking about how my wife is Pregnant and expecting soon, and this coworker piped up and said ""oh but will you raise him to be as English as you or will you let him be a true patriot"" and I responded, in front of everyone ""He'll be British like me, considering I am British not english, for the last time please get it right this is really f\*\*king annoying having to explain every 5 minutes my national identity, I wouldn't call you Californian so don't bloody call me English again"" she left the room and started crying, a couple of coworkers have called me an asshole, but I think after the multiple times I've explained the only way I would've gotten through to her is by a firm talking too

&amp;#x200B;

AITA?","NTA, but I'd opt to tell her to say ""Scottish"" instead. The contrast between Scotland and England will be sharper in most people's minds than the distinction between England and Britain.","NTA, people saying NAH are using Americans geographical ignorance as an excuse.",0,0

ce3ah8,"So here's a little background story that I'll try to keep short and objective (and probably fail miserably) for context:

My parents got divorced when I was around 4 or 5 (I obviously can't remember and no one ever really talked about so I still don't know much about it) and since then I've been moving back and forth between where both of them lived. They lived in the same city for 3 years and then my mom moved like 1000km away and took me with her. I had been with her for 3 years when my dad fought in court to have my custody (details also not revealed fully to me but my conditions living with mom weren't the best, at one point we were living behind her boyfriend's bar). 3 more years with dad, 1 with mom, 2 with dad then the rest (kind of) with mom. 

Needless to say that the moving back and forth kept me from making significant friends and my childhood friendship isn't what it could have been. Also each parent had it's fundamental flaw (imo) mom was emotionally manipulative and probably had some mental health issues, she didn't really do much all day didn't really expect anything from me but I guess was more loving than my dad, which worked all day (7am to sometimes 6pm up to 22pm), when I was younger it wasn't really that bad, but when I got older he would barely talk to me, I'd be grounded all the time because of bad grades and messy room, when he got remarried most days he would only see me at lunch and they wouldn't invite me to dinner. 

When I was 18 I got into uni because I had to. Hated every second of it but thought I'd finish it to keep my dad off my back. Turns out I couldn't do it, dropped out last year and was in a bad place mentally (I'm not diagnosed with anything, I've been to 3 psychologists when I was younger but none of them for very long, more recently I've been to 2 psychiatrists which haven't really said much but gave me prescriptions, so I don't know). 

Now my dad knows and is pressuring me about how I don't do anything and I need a job and I need to solve my problems and I need to study because otherwise I won't get a job. I know all of that and it's been really hard, I've been trying to get a job for over six months and I've just now enrolled in a gastronomy course which will give me a diploma, but my dad is having none of that.

What I feel like is they never gave me any emotional support or love, it was always about getting good grades and meeting their expectations. I never felt good enough and I personally think it stopped me from doing a lot of things, also because they would disagree with it.

I've told my dad he doesn't need to support me anymore and I've been taking a break from my mom because she's so negative. I don't know how I could have been a better daughter, but if I knew I would have been.

AITA for not being able to meet their expectations, even if they're not that demanding?","Nah. It sounds like you need to keep up the therapy though. Sounds like he worked his ass off and wanted you to do better than your deadbeat mom. He may not have handled it the right way but his heart was more than likely in the right place. It's tough, but he is right you do have to do something with your life or you're kinda fucked. Therapy is the first step and good on you enrolling in class. You're an adult. Do what is gonna make you happy and keep you from being homeless. Gastronomy or getting a job or whatever.","NTA - I’m guessing your childhood has been fairly tough, never really settling down and that and your dad can’t expect you to go to uni if you don’t want to. I think that he is right that you should try get a job, but I don’t think he is right in saying you need to get a degree to get a decent one. Just get a job, a decent income and build on that. That is enough to become successful enough, just keep working hard and stuff. I don’t think your dad is TA but I think that he shouldn’t expect quite so much from you all things considered.",3,0

I'm an audiologist and I do work for the VA. I, personally, feel that hearing loss claims are ones that fraudsters erroneously select the most thinking they can just ignore the beeps and get some quick cash. 

This guy comes in with a claim for hearing loss. Now, to be clear, you don't need to be deaf to get money from the VA. You can have normal hearing that shows a decline over time and still get a rating. The guy is doing fine. Hearing is looking normal. Then we get to a point and he basically gets everything wrong. So I call bullshit and tell him that his hearing his normal, I know what he's doing and he needs to cut it out so we can finish the test. 

He apologizes, he does look a little nervous, but he says that the small space he's in for the test is triggering a panic attack and that;s why he jacked that part of the test. Guy was a submariner so I'm not buying his claustrophobia excuse.

I note in his record that I think he was being noncompliant with the test and potentially trying to manipulate the results. That's usually all it takes. This guy, however, within a few days of the test withdrew his claim. I suspect he withdrew his claim because I called him out rather than just making a note and he didn't want my accusation to turn into a fraud investigation. 

This kind of pissed me off. I'm tired of people trying to cheat the system. My BIL is a VA Special Agent so I called him to tip him off to this guy. He tells me that it isn't going to go anywhere because 1) the guy withdrew his claim and 2) proving he tanked his test, or tried to, would be somewhat difficult as his lawyer would almost certain argue he actually did have a panic attack since the rest of the test was perfectly normal participation. He suggested I just let it go.

I chose not to.

The guy is employed as a police officer. So I called the misconduct tip line for his department and basically laid out that he was trying to cheat a compensation exam. An investigator contacted me and thanked me for my tip and said they may need to subpoena some records if they find enough to warrant more investigation.

My BIL is telling me that I fucked up big and I shouldn't have done basically any of the things I've done aside from making the note in my report. From my standpoint, if more people stepped up and actually vigorously pursued fraudsters then there would be less fraud.

What do you guys think, AITA?","YTA. Aren't people who worked in submarines more prone to claustrophobia? I feel like you are basing this off of speculation and misjudgments. Maybe he was trying to commit fraud, but he didn't. I can understand pursuing him if he actually got away with it, but this just seems like a personal vendetta.","NTA

crxblw,"We are going on vacation to the beach soon. Well there are three rooms in the place we’re staying, two with queen size beds and one with a bunk bed. My husband and I are obviously taking one of the ween rooms but my daughter was not happy when I told her her boyfriend and her had to take the bunk beds. They questioned why her younger siblings aren’t taking the bunk bed and they take the queen because they are a couple but I don’t want them fucking around. I told them straight no and said if they’re gonna complain then I’m putting them in separate rooms. AITA for not allowing them to sleep in the same bed?

dyanjh,"My girlfriend and I are both 23 year old women, and the same clothing size. I'm still in touch with my father, who is still not entirely used to me having a girlfriend, but is trying to adjust to it.

Every December, right between Christmas and New Year, his job does this charity fundraiser. It's very formal and usually starts around 6pm, and ends a bit after midnight (usually before 1am). Employees are expected to bring their entire families and all adults are allowed plus ones. Since me and my siblings (2 brothers and a sister) were kids he's always picked out our clothes. I know it sounds weird but there's usually a theme, which can be anything, and it changes every year, and the outfits are expected to be expensive. When we were kids he'd take us out for the day and buy us an outfit each, but as we've grown up and moved out this has been more difficult. Me and my siblings said a few years back that we couldn't afford to spend out on a pricey outfit every year, and didn't have time for a full on family shopping trip, so if he wanted us to come and fit the theme he would have to deal with the clothes. Since then dad has bought us all outfits and sent them to us ahead of time (no checking with us, we confirm our sizes and he orders something online and has it delivered to us, we just have to trust him with it).

Dad has been promoted a few times over the years, the last time being a few months ago, and has gone from an intern level when we were kids to now being roughly 4th in the chain of command. He asked me this year to bring my girlfriend, and I said I would, and he asked me to send both of our sizes so he could get us both outfits (he also does this for my siblings' partners). The delivery came today and he sent me a pantsuit and a dress. I've explained to him in the past that I've sort of moved away from dresses, just because I don't find them very comfortable, and prefer trousers and pantsuits.

Thinking that he sent a pantsuit for this reason I messaged him thanking him for taking that into consideration. He then replied that the pantsuit wasn't for me, it was for my girlfriend. He bought the dress with the intention of me wearing it. According to the receipt the dress is significantly more expensive. I tried it on and it looks nice, but I'm just not comfortable in it. I messaged my siblings and they confirmed that the only theme this year seems to be the colour (dark blue clothing, which dad bought all of us).

My girlfriend has said she is fine wearing either outfit, but I know she prefers dresses to suits. She's met my dad about half a dozen times, and is worried about potentially having a hand in annoying him. While the dress is really nice, it looks better on her, and I would be a lot happier in the pantsuit. However, dad has specifically said that he bought the dress with me in mind and he wants me to wear the dress, and he bought the pantsuit with my girlfriend in mind and wants her to wear that.

WIBTA for giving my girlfriend the dress and wearing the pantsuit?

Info: I can't see my dad getting angry/yelling, but I can see him being potentially disappointed. The turnout for these parties is usually around 150-200 people (but everyone gets a plus one and the venue they rent fits about 400) and the only people who would know me are the people who have worked with dad long enough to remember me and my siblings all coming to these things.","NAH, but if I were in your shoes I'd just wear the dress. Not for your dad's sake necessarily, but for your girlfriend's. This is her first time meeting your dad, do you really want her to feel like she might be making a bad impression over being in a slightly uncomfortable outfit for the evening? She can keep the dress afterward and you can keep the pantsuit.","I’d say NTA, you said yourself that you’ve moved away from dresses and prefer pantsuits etc and mentioned this multiple times to him, for him to then pick out a pantsuit and dress, while expecting you to wear the dress knowing your preference is unfair to you and putting you in a situation you wouldn’t be comfortable with. 
If he really wanted you to wear the dress knowing what you prefer, he should have got you both dresses so as to avoid this sort of issue.",3,0
evimar,"My father was never present in my life even after various attempts I made to have a real relationship with him. The little time I spent with him as child he was very abusive (it took me longer than most to lose my baby fat and he'd always make snark comments about it; he'd also compare me to evey other child he knew and I'd always not be as good as them). 

When I was ten my mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression. Things got really tough, we had to move in with my grandma who became responsible for the both of us. Money was always tight (mental ilness treatment is very expeny in my country). My grandma tried to contact my father to ask for  help with me because it was really tough for me to see my mother in the state she was in. He always said he couldn't take me in or help with extra money because he had a new family that need his attention. After a while he moved to the other side of the country and didn't talk to me for years. 

Eventually things got better, the meds started to work and now you couldn't even tell my mother has any kind of mental ilness. However, money was still short for us, especially after my mom got pregnant again even after the doctors said that was impossible (abortion is not a option in my country). 

After I finished HS I had no hopes of ever going to college because we couldn't afford, but my mom still made me take my country's equivalent of the SAT. Somehow I got a 50% scholarship for one of the best schools in the country. The problema was, even with the scholarship, we still couldn't afford and I couldn't work to pay for it because the school was in the next town and I'd spend literally every time off in traffic (we also don't have college dorms here).

At this point my dad was back in town, so I decided to give it a try and contacted him to see if he could help. He wasn't rich, but he had money and was alwaysdoings stuff with his family so I figured he would have at least a little to help me. 

But all he said was: ""can't help you,,you know that. Just find a job"". And after that he never tried to contact me again.

Right after that my mom received a very high restitution form the state and literally gave it all to me. I went to college, graduated, got a amazing job and now I paying for my sister's college.

Last month my mom made a FB post saying how much she was grateful to have me as her daughter because I was helping with my sister education and then out of the blue my dad decided to contact me and ask for me to help with his other daughter college too. I said I couldn't because I was already paying for my sister's and I was saving to buy a apartment. I also said that maybe she should get a job. I felt really great, but then them he started to say I was being a vindictive a-hole. He made a FB post about it and now a lot of people are agreeing with him to the point where I'm reconsidering it.

EDIT: 

Wow, this really blew up. I decided to make this edit because it would take me forever to respond every individual message. 

First, I want to thank you for how nice all were. Also, really thank you for whoever sent the wards, you didn't need, this is just a troaway account. 

Second, I decided I wont be making a FB post to respond to him. A lot of you said I should post my side of the sorry, but tbh I don't think people will care. The ones that are on his side knows he was never present and knows my mom was sick, they just think I should help because we're ""family"" and nothing will really change their mind. 

Thirdly, I decided to help his kids. I know I have no obligation to them, I know that maybe he's lying about his money problems, but it's just hard for me to see a person I'm technically related to in a situation I struggled so much with. But I won't be given them money per say. A very good friend of mine works teaching for a college in my city, it's far from the best school, but they offer a lot of scholarships and they are cheaper than most. He said he could get up to 25%. As I said, it's really not the best school, but it's still better than nothing if you're in need. They could try getting a loan for the other 75% or something.","NTA. Your father is an asshole.

eb8se3,"Sorry for the long post but a little backstory. My family always celebrates boxing day (and english and Canadian holiday on dec 26) at my grandmother's house. However, last year my dad and siblings refused to go to my nana's because she had some flooding in the basement and they were afraid of mold, so we had it at my aunt's house instead. My aunt smokes cigarettes and her husband smokes cigars CONSTANTLY in their house. I felt nauseous the whole time. My siblings felt nauseous the whole time. My dad didnt because he grew up around smokers and my grandparents and aunt and stepmom did not mind because they are all smokers or were at one point. 


When I say it smelled bad, I mean so bad that I might as well have walked into a cloud of smoke no matter where I went. I wanted to puke constantly. Even my clothes reeked when I left. 


My family refuses to host it somewhere else this year, and I told them that I dont want to go. I'll see 99% of them on christmas eve/Christmas day, so it's not like I wont be seeing them, but they're all claiming I should just ""get over it"" and that I'm being overdramatic.

I am appalled - and also rather confused - as to why he ate one. He told me he thought they wouldn't just have ""free samples"" of dog treats out for public, and then he showed me this little makeshift ""create your own"" dog treat area, where you can pick and choose what treats you want. Jaxxon assumed these treats were for humans and promptly proceeded to eat them.

I scolded him for being so careles and digging into ""treats"" that are clearly not meant for humans, while Jaxxon proceeds to scream at me for being a terrible mother.

I recently decided to start using okcupid again because ive met some decent guys in there, even some who im good friends with to this day, anyways, i start talking to a guy and even though he isnt my type or what i usually look for ,i thought i could get out of my comfort zone and get to know him.

Im honestly not very interested in the second option and i feel like its too much a first date, so i tell him we should go to the donut place. He asks me about my hobbies and stuff and i realize hes kinda boring and not a fast replier so i figure i'll go to the date, pay for my food and tell him were not really gonna work out.

I mention to him that since i live in Mexico and really close to the border my friends usually pick me up at a spot right after crossing the border since i dont have a car. Well the day before the date he asks me if we can meet up at a really famous park, im like okay.

aud3cv,"I (F22) bought a ticket to see a lesser known band I really like a few months ago. I showed my friend (M21) this band awhile ago, and he liked their stuff. 

When I originally bought my ticket for the show, we did not discuss going together. I had simply said I bought a ticket for it. Fast forward to last week. My friend asked me if I was still going to the concert. I replied that I was, and I had bought M&amp;G as well. He then proceeds to tell me that he had bought a ticket and ""totally forgot about it"". He said that upon look for another ticket in his e-mail, he found that he had bought a ticket for the show. He told me ""So I'll see you there?""

This made me uncomfortable for a couple of reasons. One, I am having a hard time believing he forgot he bought a ticket. Because it is a band he knows I like and knew I bought a ticket for, I find it hard to believe he wouldn't have told me when he bought it. It also sold out within the first week, so it happened fairly soon after I got mine. 

Another reason is that he has done this to me before. I bought a ticket for myself to see a band I liked, and while I was on my way to the venue, he texted me to tell me he was in line. I had no idea he was going, and I ended up having to stand with him the whole concert. When the concert ended, I was ready to Uber home, and he talked me up for an hour. 

I personally prefer going to concerts alone; I feel like I can be more carefree and when the artists mean a lot to me, it is sort of an emotional experience I feel uncomfortable sharing with others. I don't have to worry about being judged, and even if I feel my friends wouldn't judge me, it is a personal experience for me. 

Obviously I don't believe the solution is telling him he can't go to shows for bands I like. That would be completely unfair and entitled to suggest he couldn't. However, these shows aren't huge. I can't really avoid him if I wanted to, and I don't know if I am an asshole for thinking I shouldn't have to see a concert with someone just because they bought a ticket as well?

For context, I do not believe this has anything to do with romantic feelings. We don't hangout often, and mostly communicate over text. ",NTA and there's no way he isn't stalking you,"

cjvjm4,"Let me start by saying that I know my mental health isn’t an excuse to ignore friends. Just to get that in the clear.

I have a coworker that I’ve worked with for about 3 months. We’ve always had a mildly strained relationship, as he is a very unfiltered and kind of offensive dude who takes it too far a lot. We’re acquaintances, hesitant friends at best. But I have been around for a lot of rough things for him. 

He was recently diagnosed with stage 3 blood cancer and given 18 months to live. I understand that that’s rough, I really do. But he immediately lashed out at everyone and became angry, manipulative, and emotionally abusive. He started rumors towards me and then blocked me on everything so I couldn’t talk to him about it out of work, so I finally confronted him at work and he immediately went to our lead and had me pulled into the conference room for bringing personal stuff into work and I almost lost my job. 

We made peace for the sake of civility at work and now he thinks we’re best friends again. He’s been coming to me pretty regularly for support in his own drama and things and doesn’t want to just text about it, but wants to come over to my house and discuss things. I just got out of a rough therapy session and my PTSD isn’t in the best of states and didn’t want to be alone with a guy as a 19 y/o girl, so I said no to that and said we could talk at work. He immediately shut down and said it was fine and he’d just find someone else to go to and other things like that.

Now I feel like shit for not having him over and feel like I let him down. AITA?",NTA. This isn't even about either of your mental states. You are under no obligation to have someone over to your house. That is for sure a red flag situation. And the fact that he is trying to play on your emotions to get you to let him come to your house and be alone with you makes it much more so.,"NTA. It's very unfortunate that he is in the situation he is in and I cannot imagine how one copes with that. However while being ill may be a cause of his behavior, it is not an excuse for it.

b0nux0,"I ordered some Thai food for pickup over the phone and went to get it. The layout of the resteraunt was similar to [this](http://www.girlsguidetoparis.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Pont-de-Yunnan.jpg) random picture from Google images. The tables were set with forks and knives.

I took a seat while waiting a few extra minutes for them to finish my order, then they brought it to the table I was at, wrapped up for takeout. I was going to take it to my car but I was super hungry so said fuck it and started eating it there. A minute later a woman working there kindly told me you can't sit if you order pickup and I left.

I would understand if they were busy, but I was literally the only person there and there were like at least 15 seats. I know this is super insignificant but I'm just curious if I was having shit manners or if they are slight jerks / listening to their managers' orders.

EDIT: I'm satisfied with the answers I've already received so unless anyone has something in particular to say I don't need any more feedback :) thank you to everyone who commented","YTA. I’ve been working in a restaurant for three years and I hate when people order carry out and then decide to eat it there. Sure, they may have not have been busy but they also may have been saving that table. It is also a sneaky way for people to not tip because it’s carryout but you occupied a space. Not saying this was you, but that’s how it feels sometimes. 

Unless you told someone that you decided to eat there, then it was inconsiderate of you. ","YTA unfortunately. Togo boxes, plastic utensils and bags all cost money. The idea behind take out being the same price as eating in (excluding tip, which you didn’t leave) is because you’re leaving and they pay for the ‘extras’ they give you. You taking the Togo items and opening them up in the store means they will have to clean up after you or take care of your trash. It also gives others the idea that it’s okay to do that. 

If they had 5 customers a week do what you did that’d be a loss of like $10 in materials and even more in labor. Doesn’t seem like much but from a business standpoint it’s bad.",1,1
axy8hv,"This is a bit of a long story but will try to make it as brief as possible.

I dated a guy for 9 months back in 2016. He was from a town 3hrs away and so we didn't see each other through the week, only on weekends when he came to stay with me (I was a lowly student, he had a job and could afford the weekly train fare). We talked non-stop, texts, photos and video chats. So it was heartbreaking for me when he suddenly stopped responding for 5 days. He wasn't on fb/insta but I remembered him mentioning twitter competitions. Queue super sleuth mode.My super desperate self trawled through every account under his name until I found him...he was alive and tweeting since he went AWOL. Trawled through his tweets and I found one mentioning 'his gf' with another user @'d... she had her insta linked to her twitter and so I fell face first into this strangers wonderful shiny documented 3yr relationship with my bf. It was absolutely horrifying, I cried for days.

My friends talked me out of contacting this girl, I sent him one last, long, explosive message and 'moved on'. It's coming up to 3yrs now and I have the most wonderful loving partner, I am genuinely happy with my life. But I still get this sick feeling when ex's come up in conversation, that I never tried to warn this poor girl. It came up again last night and I caved and looked at her insta this morning (we share the same first name so it's a name I'm not likely to forget) - they're still together, bought a house together, a dog, engaged, celebrating 6yrs together.

WIBTA for telling her? I just need to know if I'm doing the right thing by leaving it when my heart sometimes says I'm not.  The level of sneakiness on his part always made me feel like I was not the first. My partner is ambivalent. Thoughts??

ckh2s4,"This just happened ten minutes ago.  
For the past two months, my ex GF and I have been playing Minecraft on a realm. I paid for the first month, she paid for this month. However, during this time she was using an account that I paid for and that I own. She used my main account, and I used this alt. Eventually we decided to switch accounts since I like using my real one. She was now playing on the account that has the realm in its name.   
Over the end of the first month, and all of the second month, I started coming on less and less. Life gets in the way of games sometimes, and my desire to hop on and build was 0(I like fighting people in block games, sue me).  
I got on tonight and told her I was going to summon in some parrots to make them dance, she then immediately de-op'd me and said she didn't want me cheating. I went to sign onto the account that she played on, that I owned, and saw she changed the password ten seconds ago, in anticipation of me doing what I was doing. I immediately changed the login for both my accounts, and she's been locked out since. She's currently yelling at me how I'm immature and I didn't have the right to do that. Am I the asshole?","ESH.

csckn0,"There’s this girl I know. This girl has terrible hygiene. I don’t think she ever showers or washes her hands, which is disgusting to begin with, and even more disgusting when you pair it with the fact that she’s a college athlete. 

This girl and I share some friends, and occasionally my friends and I have a game night in one of our school’s classrooms. Anyone who wants to come is welcome. When we have these game nights, I usually bring my Wii and some controllers so that we can all play MarioKart and games like that. 

On one of our first game nights we had, she showed up with her hands covered in a mystery substance (my theory is that it was ice cream but I’m not 100% sure) and sneezed on one of my controllers. Because of this, I had to take both Wiimotes apart and clean them thoroughly. I have had to clean my Wiimotes on multiple occasions because of her. 

Anyways, I recently purchased a used gamecube controller off of eBay. It was very grubby, which was okay because I bought the controller with the intent of restoring it. While I was reassembling the controller, I realized that taking apart the controllers isn’t something I want to do very often. I also realized that if she keeps coming to these game nights, I will have to keep cleaning the controllers unless if I do something about it. 

WIBTA if I refused to let her use my Wiimotes if she doesn’t wash her hands?","NTA 

If you don’t want to seem like an asshole, maybe bring some some of those wet wipes and just say “everyone wipe your hands with a wipe before picking up my controllers so they don’t get dirty and we don’t get sick”

bzklk5,"This is a pretty straightforward one. 

Sometime in late January I started to talking to this girl at my college, and we hit it off pretty immediately and started hanging out a lot. I really liked her, so I asked her out after a few weeks had passed. She said she wasn't interested, but she'd like to still be friends. I thought this would be fine, as I barely knew her at the time and thought I could pretty easily kill those feelings. But then some months passed and I started to really like her, and by this point she'd become one of my closest friends. I did my best to ignore these feelings, but then one day they bubbled up and I couldn't ignore them any longer. I had to see, just one more time, if there was any chance she felt the same way. So I asked her if she did, and was again rejected, but this time it hard. I'd grown to develop some really strong feelings for this girl, so hearing that she didn't feel the same really hurt. But I dealt with it, and tried to move on as if nothing had changed. At this point it was pretty close to summer, so I figured I could keep hanging out with her, acting as if I'd moved on from her rejection, and then once the summer came, I'd be able to get over her for real. But here's the problem: it's been a month since I left for vacation and I still think about her daily. I've texted her a lot, but she travels and lives abroad, so we've only been able to call each other like twice. You'd figure with minimal contact I'd be able to forget about her. But I can't shake this one part of me that wants to believe that maybe she'll change her mind, even though I know realistically that that's not going to happen. I honestly feel like I can't even think about flirting with other girls as long as I feel like this, and whenever I think of her maybe being with some other dude in Morocco, I get so mad and jealous that I can't stand it. I feel trapped, like I can't move on with my life as long as the two of us remain friends. So I'm considering calling her and telling her that we can't be friends anymore. But after months of hanging out, this feels like it would be unfair to just out of the blue stop being friends with her. WIBTA?","NAH. She isn't required to want to date you, and you aren't required to pretend you don't feel that way. Neither of you are asssholes.","NTA. You can decide to not be friends with someone if the situation makes you feel uncomfortable.  I don't think I'd ""call her"" to talk about not being friends though.  That's just being dramatic.  

It's actually pretty easy to stop being friends: Stay polite but stop making an effort. Don't agree to plans, don't hang out. Eventually, they'll stop asking and you'll drift apart. Then one day, when you run into each other again in 10 years, it'll be a pleasant suprise instead of an awkward one.

BTW, the above will actually happen naturally with people you DO like and DO want as a friend.  It's part of getting older.  No need to force something that will happen on its own if you just stop putting forth the effort.",3,0

agjh60,"So this happened a few days ago and I'm trying to grapple with left over feelings. 

Background: My partner and I had a few weeks break in the new year and had planned a semi-local two week trip. At the same time we planned for my parents to come for one of the weeks and are visiting from my home country. We planned to stay together and do activities in that time. My Mom generously said my Dad and her would cover things while we were together. Awesome. I'm super thankful for them doing this. So one of the days we finish a small fishing trip and some wine tasting and my partner and I had discussed maybe doing dinner just the two of us. I ask/let my Mom know that we wanted to have a dinner out, just the two of us and they are all sweet with it and say they're planning on eating in. Side note, my Dad still cooks like 6 people still live in a house so already on our holiday we have too much food. So we eventually find a place, order, eat and have some leftovers of a half n' half pizza. We end up going back to the AirBnb and I go to chill in the our room. My Mom comes in chewing on a piece of my partner's pizza and sits down on the bed staring at me. I kinda gave her this look to which she says something along the lines of ""What..why are you looking at me like that/what's the matter??"" I think I said something like ""Well, that's Dan's pizza... you should have asked."" Immediately she gets angry/hurt/defensive, says something (can't remember), I respond then she leaves. Suddenly outside the room on the balcony I hear her talking quite upset to my partner about what I said.   


Dan didn't know at all what was going on. He had come out of the toilet and was having a smoke when she came up. (D for Dan, M for Mom)

M: ""Sorry Dan I ate a piece of pizza, I hope thats fine""

D: ""Absolutely, not a problem, but I would liked to be asked in the future.""

M: ""Why?""

D: ""Its just common courtesy.""

M: ""But we've paid for everything. We've paid for the trip, accomodation, activities. I don't have to ask for a bit of pizza.""

D: ""Its still common courtesy to ask regardless of what has been done.""

M: ""Well I've given you all this and I expect the same in return.""

At this point we were just trying to get across that common courtesy should be used no matter the case. We paid for the pizza and still may have wanted it, but were happy to share. We tried giving other examples but it boiled down to her believing/expectation that if she gives then she expects to receive no questions in return. We tried to explain that she made it seem like listing what they've paid for was more a gift with strings attached rather than an unconditional gift. We also said that while those might be her expectations, other people (like us) don't necessarily expect the same of others.

It ended with silence, in the morning it was the same and is still technically unresolved but I was left feeling like I wasn't wrong but guilty because she/my Dad had paid for everything. Reddit, am AITA somewhere in this?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Mom and Dad paid for part of a two week trip we (including my partner) spent together. Mom got upset when I said she should have asked before taking a slice of pizza from our dinner out. My partner and I were just bringing up common courtesy while she felt that paying for accommodation, activities and groceries entitled her to a simple slice of pizza/not needing to ask. AITA for saying she should have just asked first.","NTA don't know how many times I've gotten pissed off at my family for eating things I've brought without asking, even though 99 percent of the time I would say yes. Its rude doesn't matter weither its family or not. ","YTA

You sound like a petulant child, tbh. If she had crossed the boundary in some other way perhaps it might have warranted a discussion, but she ate a slice of pizza. Yes, it was \*yours\*. But it was in the refrigerator, in the airbnb, on the cute vacation that she and your father were paying for. They went out of their way to do you a kindness and show you AND your partner a good time and spend time with you, and you threw a little hissy fit because she ate one of your leftovers after you went out on a date night? It was a stupid piece of pizza, and you had to make a big issue out of it? I would feel super disrespected if I were your mom. You sound so so selfish. 

There's some nuance here that should be looked at that the other posters on here saying you're NTA are missing. This isn't a situation were your parents came into town and demanded you give them all of your attention and expected you to pay for shit or reimburse them in any way. They literally just wanted to spend time with you and treat you to a good time. So what if your mom didn't think to ask about eating fucking leftovers? I'll bet they've been paying for all the other dinners right? Your reaction lacked grace, class, and consideration of your mothers feelings. Her expecting basic politeness from you after treating you to an awesome time (ie not freaking out over her eating something in the communal fridge) is not out of line.

I just can't imagine acting so ungrateful to my mom. You really ought to apologize. ",0,1
axln8p,"I pay for prime completely out of pocket ($100 for one year) and used to let everyone in my immediate family use it. I never had a problem with my parents or sister using it till now. 

I have depression, a host of anxiety disorders, and have had anorexia for a few years now (even being hospitalised on multiple ocassions) and watch cartoons/anime (particullary the cute/innocent ones somewhat meant for kids.) 

I have been doing this to cope with with things since i was first hospitalized at the age of 9ish (using pirating sites back then) and it built into a habit in order to deal with stress. 

My sister had been making fun of me for watching ""those purvy shows"" and had been calling me a lesbian when we live in a fundamal Christian household, so the aqusation could have serious consequences (i am a lesbian/atheist, either of which could get me kicked out of the house if i were to come out of the closet)

I changed my password so she couldn't watch her shows, and my parents are taking her side.

e76nxq,"My wife wanted to go to graduate school in a different state in a city ten times bigger than where we previously lived.  I had been wanting to get out of our rural area for a while so I found a job and we relocated.  Parking anywhere near my office is expensive and the city has great public transport from just outside our home to a block from my office I can take a bus.  I understood this when moving, and my plan was to primarily use public transportation.  With this in mind we sold one of our cars before moving.

&amp;#x200B;

My job is stressful and often requires more than 8 hour days.  Usually I am fine taking the bus, but today I worked 7am to 5pm without a chance to take a break.  It was a really busy day and I could not face taking a crowded bus for 45 minutes to get home.  I asked my wife for a ride and she said she didnt feel up to picking me up.  This is often her answer and she rarely concedes to picking me up on these kind of days.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I do not believe my wife should drop everything and be at my beckon call.  However, she takes our teen daughter anywhere she wants to go and picks her up at any time.  We often have to build our vehicle schedule around her social life.  Today, I sucked it up and took the bus.  When I got home my wife is not here.  I find out she is out driving my daughter to her friends house, even after we had a talk earlier in the week about her going out too much and staying out too late.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really upset that the kids social life is worth making the trip, but I am left to just deal with it.  I have not spoken to my wife yet, but I am not sure if being resentful makes me an asshole.  I am not going to be angry with my wife, maybe I am just more hurt and want perspective before broaching the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE:  I did talk to my wife last night.  Apparently the issue arose from a misunderstanding and bad timing.  Our daughter was given permission to go to a friend's house after school prior to us talking about her going out too much.  My wife felt that because the plan was made before the talk, she would still be allowed to go (as she was not being punished for anything, we were just setting general expectations.  My daughter thought she had been disallowed from going out and came home directly after school.  My wife told her she was still allowed to go out.  When I asked for a ride she was doing dishes.  When she finished she felt bad about the miscommunication and gave my daughter the ride.

I feel like an asshole for being frustrated and upset without all the details.  Thank you all for giving me some perspective.","NAH

Nothing wrong with having a shitty day and wanting to spend time with your wife and get a lift home to avoid the bus, however she isn't in the wrong either for prioritizing your daughter over a functional adult.

Ninja Edit: Have a sit down conversation about it, see if there is something that can be worked out, this seems like a minor issue that can get resolved fairly easily","INFO: when she does pick you up, do you complain about work on the drive?

I ask because I’ve literally refused rides and opted to take the bus because of people consistently being negative and downright emotionally draining on the way back from school/work. Being trapped in tight space with someone who’s very stressed and trying to vent about their horrible day can be pretty emotionally taxing and it’s very understandable that she doesn’t want to make a habit out of it. Maybe 45 min ride gives you time to cool off that she appreciates/needs?",3,3

afhfpv,"My GF wanted to go to Japan for her birthday. I've always wanted to go there too. I booked the flights to Tokyo with a stop in New Delhi.

After we landed in New Delhi, I realized I couldn't find my passport. They would not let me board the Tokyo plane without it. She couldn't go without me because the hotel reservations were in my name. Neither of us could exit the airport because we had no Indian visas. We told the police about the situation and, long story short, they got us on a flight back to our home country.

So that is how I ruined my girlfriend's birthday. We have nothing to do for the next two weeks.

Now she is angry at me. In my defence:

* I did not lose the passport on purpose.
* I have done everything I can to make the situation better. I even offered to book a last-minute trip somewhere closer where I could go with my ID card. Switzerland? Italy? Turkey? Nope, she's ""too depressed now"" to enjoy those places after what happened. (Not trying to disrespect her feelings with that. It's just what she said.)
* I paid for the flights and the hotels. While she is going to have a disappointing birthday, I've also said goodbye to 3000 €. Yeah it sucks for both of us but don't be mad at me.

Still, I feel like I fucked up. I think losing it was ultimately my fault. If I wasn't so careless, she would be having the best birthday of her life right now.

Am I the asshole?

TL;DR I promised GF a trip for her birthday, I lost my passport on the plane, and we got sent back. She's upset. I'm trying to make the situation better but it was probably my fault.

Edit: It was in my pocket, and I was sleeping in a position where it could have easily fallen out.

Edit 2: We could not leave the airport because we did not have the documents to enter India. As EU citizens we need to apply for an eVisa four days in advance, which I did not do because it costs US$80 per person and we didn't think we would need it. That is why we couldn't go to the embassy for an emergency passport replacement.","YTA. Not on purpose, but seriously dude you need to guard your passport with your life when you're travelling.

euofya,"Alright, so.

I (20F) have a sister (17F) who I currently live with and share a bathroom with.

I love her very much, we have a generally great relationship. This is weird, because she's quite hygienic in every way except one: She seldom washes her hands after using the bathroom.

I'm somewhat of a germaphobe, and I work in a hospital so I know just how disgusting people's hands are. We're literally loaded with germs. It simply disgusts me that she'll use the bathroom and not wash her hands.

Here's where I might be the asshole. I've tried being nice, but I'm at a point where I've reached the end of my rope. I find it incredibly disgusting, and last night, I kind of freaked out. I didn't insult her or call her names or anything, but I did say that I'm sick to death of her disgusting habit and I told her that toddlers know how to do this, so she should too.

I think I'm completely justified, but whenever I bring it up, she always rolls her eyes and is rude to me. She treats me like it's an unreasonable request that she wash her hands before touching things in our shared living space, and that ""sometimes she just forgets"". Again, my argument was that if toddlers can remember to do this, so can she. She's not stupid, she's just lazy.

My parents also think I'm TA. They've reminded her multiple times but she just won't listen, so they've stopped. They say that I'm just making things worse by getting annoyed like this and ""fostering division"". I will not give up but I'm wondering if there is ever a point to which it's futile and I should just learn to put up with it.",[deleted],"NTA but I might add that she may be displaying oppositional behaviour to what she may perceive as nagging from you.

80kkj7,"I asked an acquaintance to watch my apartment and two bearded dragons over the weekend (the one is too small yet to travel) and she said she was available. Let’s call her A. A asked if her friend M could stay in the apartment with her and I said yes because I also know M somewhat. 

Friday to Sunday we’re good until I got a text from M saying that A got really sick and she had to take her home. I knew A wasn’t feeling well before I left so that wasn’t a big deal, I just got another friend to pick up the keys to check in on the lizards Monday morning. I got home around 2:00 Monday afternoon and put my bags down and noticed a few of the following things. 

1-they left a massive pile of towels and sheets and blankets which costed me around $20 to wash. 

2-Instead of using the dish scrubby that was hanging on the kitchen faucet, M had dug through the cleaning cabinet and took a used sponge to wash dishes. This sponge happened to be the sponge I use to clean the bathroom including the toilet. So all the dishes had to be rewashed and sanitized. 

3- Even though the dishes were “washed” there were still chunks of food stuck to them

4- there were two full garbage bags sitting on the kitchen floor.  

5- there was poo all over the toilet seat

6- there was poo on the floor 

7- there was poo flecks on the back of the door 

8- the bathtub was filthy

9- oh and more poo on the radiator

10- One of the bags in the kitchen was a bag full of poo soaked paper towels. In my kitchen. 

So I’m conflicted. A obviously had no control over her bowels due to sickness, I feel bad for her and honestly when you got to go you got to go. So she went home and trusted M to take care of cleanup and she did a crap (hehe) job.
I am really mad at the quality of cleaning as I keep a very clean house. I don’t know if I should pay A for the weekend because she did watch the pets/apartment for 3/4 days, or not pay her because of the mess, almost like that covers the cost of cleaning. (I clean professionally so it’s like hiring me to clean for me, does that make any sense?)","I don’t blame you for not wanting to pay her, but look at the big picture here...

Is it hard for you to find people to watch your bearded dragons? She was willing to do it...and stay at your house. Your friend got sick... she couldn’t help it. She didn’t leave the house a disaster. Her friend did. I’m sure A is mortified. 

First ask yourself if you will ever need to ask for her help watching your dragons again....and that could help you make your decision.

I’d let it go and pay her but explain that her friend did a shit job cleaning up it actually cost you more money. Don’t pay the “friend.” A can decide if she wants to pay her friend out of the money you pay her. ","You didn't hire M. M jumped in to help A who obviously became too ill to care for your pets. M had no obligation to you outside of not being an asshole guest and the offer of ""helping"" A. 

If you don't have a washer and dryer, she was nice enough to collect all the dirty sheets and put them in one place. The cost of that falls on you period. 

How was she supposed to know about the sponge? Maybe M didn't recognize the scrubby as being for the dishes even if hanging from the sink? Either way, it's nitpicking. You don't get paid to clean your own house so your profession and charging her is unreasonable. 

The poop is just gross. I'd pay her and if she's someone you can really trust with your pets, salvage the relationship (maybe give her one more chance to redeem herself) because THAT is worth more than you realize. Sounds like M had quite a large bit to clean up and said ""fuck this"". Unfortunately, M isn't who you hired and was doing all of this out of the kindness of their heart it seems.

You pay because she did take care of your pets as she was hired to do. Maybe next time don't have her stay at the house since she's an unreliable house guest.",0,3
cnaove,"Throwaway because I'm embarrassed I may be a bad sister and daughter. 

So I am getting married and am thrilled about that, but when I think of the events I should look forward to, suddenly I dread them a bit because I have a sibling who ridicules me. An example is that she generally makes derisive comments about my appearance like the subtle ""this is too big for me... maybe you want it"" or more outright ""some of us care about our bodies,  so won't eat that crap. it's why you look like that"" usually referencing trying something like cheese (she's an off and on vegan, but thinks dairy is bad) or a dessert at family gatherings. It's not just weight she focuses on, but it's her favorite. 

Here's the thing though, I'm in good shape (i'm a decent swimmer and runner with a petite build) and neither of us has ever been overweight. I feel this comes from her past with eating disorders and current mental health issues, so she lashes out to make herself feel better. And I still love her, but I won't lie it doesn't make me want to hang out with her. 

BUT my mother says I only have one sister and thinks I'm being unfair by not inviting her to shop for a dress.  She believes my sister is changing so I should trust her to behave, despite her mental health crisis just last week and that she sabotaged a family trip, causing drama by skipping at the last minute in weeks prior (I wasn't there so am taking my father's and extended family's word as true). My sister is fun sometimes and has good points, so I am considering it. I mentioned her opinion to my fiance, but he said she makes him worry about me (she sometimes threatens to hit), and her meltdown last week we both have a difficult time seeing her as a mature adult who won't cause problems. I think it's nice he's supportive,  but he's clearly biased because he doesn't want me to be hurt- he probably doesn't care if i'm a shit sister. 

I know it's selfish,  but I really would like to just be happy and not be anxious about snide comments made while buying a dress.  It's incredibly shallow, but I just want to feel confident and I never feel that way knowing that my sister may come in with another ""You were always the smart one, so who cares if you're not pretty?"" It sounds weird but I live far away from family  and usually  feel great about myself and my looks and I have a hard time when she's around. It makes me just want to ensure I'll have quality time with my mom with no one to pick on me or start crying about every lunch place being bad for her diet, because I hardly see my mom and just want to have fun with her this time. Yes, it's such a little thing,  but it's how I feel.

TLDR: I'm getting married and buying a wedding dress.  Am I a massive butt if I don't invite my sister who picks on my appearance out of my selfish desire to enjoy the experience with my mom and feel confident in the dress we pick?","NTA. 

Do not include her - she is toxic and horrible, and dumping her mental illness all over you. 

Invite her to the wedding when your husband will be there to have your back, but don't include her in dress shopping and whatnot - she will ruin it, and then you will resent her when you think back. Go with your mum, or if your mum is going to be a pain, go with a good girlfriend.",NTA but I would let her come under the strictest stipulations. Let her know she is welcome but one (1) single insult or comment out of her mouth then the day is over and you will go dress shopping without her at a later date. Make it very clear to her that this is non-negotiable. If she agrees then great she is aware of what is expected of her and if she doesn't then I personally think that speaks volumes regarding how she had intended to behave.,0,0

The poor bride seemed to be at her wits end, her maids were trying to help. The MOB wanted the bride to wear her hair down and curly, the bride wanted her hair to be this lovely updo. They actually started yelling at each other.

I slid in and politely suggested a compromise, half-up/half-down, that way everyone was happy. The MOB was pacified and went to sit down. The bride was silent but I managed to perk her up enough to tell me exactly what she wanted.

e55fc4,"Back in April, I submitted a tattoo inquiry to a shop that had a pretty famous tattoo artist I found through Instagram. I had a phone consultation with the tattoo artist and was able to book a two-day session all the way out in September 2020, since he was booked that far in advance. Part of the booking required a $250 deposit that would go towards the cost of the tattoo at the end, and this was sent to his personal Venmo account.

I found out recently that this tattoo artist died (not sure the details) in late October. I am shocked and disappointed that I can no longer get his beautiful art on my body, but I did not know him on a personal level. 

WIBTA if I contact the tattoo shop to try to get my $250 deposit back? The shop is in another state from where I am so I would have to email or call.

I just can't help but wonder what all the other clients who also put down a deposit are doing in this situation.","NAH probably. But the tattoo shop might genuinely not be able to help you.

es4wwj,"We’ve been coming here for months and I know most of the dogs. Many dog owners let theirs off leash before going into the park - because they’re trained, like mine. 

My 2 are well behaved and labs. 1 is allowed off leash as she stays close to my side, and comes when I call. We’ve done this many times there. 

My other is behaved, too, but has to be on a leash as he likes to run. 

A different lady comes in with her small dog. She asks if it was ok as I was in the big dog side. I said it’s fine - people bring their little ones in here all the time. She comes in and the dogs interact fine. 

I made a good rapport with this lady, told her we usually come earlier in the mornings. There’s also smaller dogs that come in there, so he’d have someone more his size to play with. 

Shortly before we decided to head out, I saw this other lady walk up with her little dog, but then she turned away and went to the little dog side. 

Me and the 1st lady go to leave, laughing about our pups and how she will come in the morning since we had such a good time, I leash mine, she leashes hers, and I open the gate to go to my car, right by the gate. 

I hear a bark and look left and see my girl trotted over to the little dog gates side, and that woman’s dog goes ballistic on the other side of the fence. My dog barks just once and I say her name and she comes immediately next to me. I apologize, but before I could get it out this lady (2l) let’s into me (1l will be nice lady) - the all caps are not exaggerated. 

2l - YOU NEED TO HAVE YOUR DOG ON A LEASH. THERES A LEASH LAW HERE. YOUR DOG ATTACKED MINE.

me - *taken aback as this was the first time anyone made a stink about the leash law, considering I’m not the only 1 who does this - and what she say?*

Um, I’m sorry, but no, I know my dog, that’s why I trust her off leash and called her back, which is exactly what she did. She didn’t att- 

2l - NO, YOUR DOG ATTACKED MY DOG. YOU SHOULD HAVE CONTROL OF YOUR DOG AT ALL TIMES. IT BARKED AT MINE!

me - because dogs bark? And no, mine didn’t-

2l - YES IT DID! THATS WHY I WAITED ON THIS SIDE OF THE FENCE TO SEE IF YOUD LEASH YOUR DOG. I KNEW YOU DIDNT HAVE IT LEASHED. AND IT ATT -

me - ok, ma’am. 
I turn to walk to my car and get my dogs in, and she’s still screaming. 

2l - YOUR DOG COULD HAVE HURT MY DOG!

Me - excuse me, no. She loves to play and she was excited to see a new pup. 

2l - IT IS TOO AGGRES- 

I then just turned to ignore her, and 1l simply stated - um, well, see ya later. I said a friendly bye, because yea, that was awkward. 

Yes. There is a leash law. I had her leash in the car. But even if she was on the leash, she would have pulled me over to see the other dog anyway, because the little dogs door is RIGHT next to the big dogs. The interaction would have happened either way.

You are assuming strangers are comfortable with your big dog off it's leash in an area dedicated to all dogs.

bkdcdp,"I (20f) currently live with my (immigrant) parents while I commute to college. They have control over everything I do. I must text them when I leave and arrive at places or I'm yelled at. I must send them the addresses when I want to stay with friends overnight. They tried tracking me through snapchat at one point but I quit the app because of this. 

I proposed to my parents that I go on a small vacation with my boyfriend (20m) for two nights to a location we would be driving to. Immediately my mother said no and told me to discuss the situation with my father. I talked with him and he said he'd have to discuss it with her. 

Two days later, walk by my mom's room and she tells me straight up that I'm not allowed to go. I kept my cool with her and asked why they wouldn't let me go. My mother states, ""it doesnt look good having a girl go with her boyfriend alone on a trip"". She grew up in a different country than the one I live in now and has a very old fashioned way of thinking. 

I believe that because I am legal in the country that I live in, I shouldn't have to ask for permission to go, but rather just keep them updated and let them know I'm safe.

Nothing can stop you from going on the trip since you are an adult. It’s your vehicle and getting away from parents who “helicopter,” would not make you an asshole. You don’t need a permission slip to be an adult. Especially if you are going to be safe and provide updates. 

Only drawback is since you live with them they may scold you or punish you for defying them. They no doubt have good intentions but the tracking things a bit odd.

ejbs50,"I am going to graduate this year with 2 job offers in cities Z (east coast) and R (west coast). My girlfriend of 1 year and I are currently living in city Z. I think she is perfect in every way and I never felt this way before with anyone. I enjoy spending time with her everyday and we see a future together. We considered about moving in together a few times in city Z until she finished her undergrad. However, I recently got a job offer in city R that pays significantly higher (about 40K more) than in city Z. I tried negotiating the job in city Z to match but I can't negotiate any further.

My options right now are:

\- Stay in city Z (higher cost of living) and take a pay cut to be with my girlfriend.

\- Do long distance for 2 years until my girlfriend finishes her undergrad.

However, long distance is very taxing on a relationship, especially this one since neither my partner or I have ever done a long distance for that long. The last one we did was 4 months, and we were constantly sad from being so far from eachother. So I offered another alternative:

\- Girlfriend transfers to the university in city R. The credits transfer over, she pays a lot less in tuition and living expenses, and the reputation is equal or even better for grad school/med school. Her family also lives in city R - so we can visit them more often.

There is a catch - her parents are unlikely to approve it - their mentality is 'stick with it until the end', but I would still like to try convincing them. I discussed about this option twice or three times with my girlfriend and she doesn't like my proposal about her transferring schools for me. She won't even apply for the transfer. Her concern is against being too close to her parents as she wants more independence. Her parents would not pay for her living expenses if she lives so close to campus (because she would be living at home). So I suggested that I will pay for her living expenses and we can move in together, but then she's concerned that there will be a power imbalance in this relationship. There are other minor problems that might come up, but I suggested that we should take some time to go through every option on a spreadsheet and work them out individually.

The application deadline for the transfer is in 2 weeks. I suggested that she should still apply for the transfer and then accept/reject it once we finally decide on the best option - so that we can keep all opportunities open. After all, I'm still keeping the option in city Z open (with the significant pay hit). But she is upset that I am pushing her to apply because she thinks this plan is 'illogical', is never going to work, and that I'm not sacrificing much for this option. But I see this opportunity as benefit for her as well as my career.

etbfrw,"I was on one of those airport rail links they have to get you to different sections of large airports. I was just staring outside the window enjoying the scenery in a moderately crowded train (people were standing, but you could still move around freely)

This attractive woman got on and I did glance at her for a couple seconds but as I had a girlfriend back home and it’s rude to stare at anyone I went back to appreciating scenery quickly. However since my right eye is blind, it seems to onlookers that I’m staring at something on the right side of my periphery. Hence I was staring outside, but the woman was standing to the right so it kinda looked like I was staring at her.

So this other woman walks up to me, blue pixie cut and catty voice and just starts to go off on me for staring. I admit I was riled up pretty much immediately and asked her if she was in the business of making fun of disabled people instead of diffusing the situation. When she asked what the fuck I was talking about I pointed to my eye and said “I can only see out of my left, which was clearly appreciating the scenery outside”. She responded but honestly I wasn’t listening and just told her to fuck off with her assumptions. The rest of the passengers started kind of looking at us, mostly her.

I forget the rest of the snapchats, but at some point I replied “pizza and a movie” and he replied “yeah see you soon!” It was just an innocent phrase but I didn’t eat that day and assumed we’d get food together.

I show up and he has the movie. I say “so are we getting food?” 

He says “I already ate. But I’m sure you have apps on your phone if you want something.” Then he leaves to go to the bathroom.

I say “Hey, I don’t wanna be weird, but I thought we were getting pizza.” 

He says in a sympathetic tone, “Oh. I see. You must have been confused. YOU mentioned the food, not me. I should have cleared that up, I ate earlier. Sorry if that wasn’t clear. We can still get a pizza if you want. Just pick anywhere nearby and order it.”

This is still kind of shitty to me, but I ignore it and order one large pizza. The pizza shows up. I eat two slices of it. The rest of it sits there the entire movie. He doesn’t offer to contribute the $6 it would cost to split it. He tries to make out with me during the movie. I stop him and feel too weird to be into it. 

After the movie, I decide it would be better just to talk about it rather than feel bad. I tell him my feelings and how he’s weird with money and I’m uncomfortable. He feels bad and gives me $6 right away and thanks me for speaking up. There was no bad intention at all. No red pill, no plan, nothing. Just a dude who didn’t think my pizza was his responsibility. 

Then he asks me to have sex with him.

I decline. Knowing we still have to work together, I manage to tiptoe out the door.

a5qi7d,"Tl;dr I let my dogs fight off another dog after their owner took it off leash to ""introduce"" them without talking to me prior?


I live in a small collection of townhomes. I share a front stoop, plus one unit on each of our sides, so 4 units split over a building. 

We are allowed to have two dogs and my fiance wanted to rescue a couple pups. One from an abusive/more negligent owner(catahoula hound). The other was abandon with an ex who couldn't have pets at their residence. She was abusive and left her without food much of the time because she didnt take the time to potty train her(GSD). She is around 4 years old and barely 40 pounds. Her lack of nutrition caused growth stunting. 

Now my catahoula doesnt like other dogs. I'm guessing the owner threw out food for all the dogs and he had to fight for his food. We got him around 7 mo old. They had about 5 or 6 other farm dogs and her lack of ability to answer questions about his previous vet records was also a red flag. 

My GSD doesn't like people. I've seen her go full police dog towards certain people. Guessing people that are similar to her previous owners, like my old man. She has back him into corners growling and snarling with teeth bared, ears flat, and hair up. 

I always leash them on fairly short leads and will take them up to the mail box occasionally to get mail. Neighbor across the street has two rottweilers they they leave tied up outside in afternoons when it's over 35 degrees. 

My dogs will growl and bark at them and they growl and bark back. One day while checking the mail, neighbor walks out and across the street to talk to me. I pulled dogs behind me and held onto their collars while he asked if he could pet them. They weren't happy with him and I told him they were rescues and weren't super fond of people. He kept his distance as they growled and said that he would want to introduce our dogs sometime. Again I told him it wasnt a good idea and that they weren't fond of people or dogs. 

Fast forward a few weeks and I'm checking the mail with both my puppers on leashes and all the sudden i see neighbors rottie running across the street. I think she got off her tie out and start pulling dogs back towards the door about 75 yards away.  

The rottie Closed the 20 yards before I could drag my dogs 10 feet. Neighbor shouted that he wants to try ""introducing"" the dogs from their yard. While slowly walking over.

 I almost immediately drop the leashes and let my dogs rip at his rottie while feigning to stop them. I grabbed their collars after maybe 30 seconds after they turned the rottie into a chew toy. 

He finally grabbed her collar and pulled her back a ways after slowly walking across the street. ""Yeah I was hoping to avoid that by introducing them...""

""Your dogs may be friendly, but mine arent."" 

He went back inside taking the one tied up inside also. He hasn't tried to talk to me since(about a year now). 


AITA for letting my dogs gang up on my neighbors dog for his poor excuse of ""introducing"" them? ","Hell yeah YTA, I get that they're not fond of people and he was a bit pushy but you don't purposely let your dog's attack another at all.

b2j33l,"I'm an American and a sophomore in college, almost a junior. My dream has been to do a study abroad at some point in my college. I'm someone who is privileged enough to be able to have vacation time with my family to various places across the world, and that is something I am forever grateful to be able to do. Its become a family tradition, as we've been doing this at least once a year for \~6 years. I love travel, and any time I catch a whiff of the next place we'll be visiting I try to immerse myself in the language, culture, and history of whatever country/region I'm going to. It's something I hold dear to my heart. 

My girlfriend and I have been together for 2 years now. She's occasionally able to go with me on my family vacations and they're the fondest times I have; me, her, and my family all spending time together and making memories is a treasure to me. We miss each other dearly when she's not able to go, and it gets harder and harder to leave. 

The problem; Next spring, I have the chance to study in Spain for half the semester. This is something I have always wanted to do. It's corny, but northern Spain has an almost mystical status in my mind because most of my family traces its roots there. I've been before, and the study abroad will be in a place where I've stayed (Oviedo, in Asturias). I meet all the requirements to go and it'd be an amazing experience.

When I told my SO, she was against the idea. She said that it would be a really long time away from each other and she hates the idea of me being away so long, as well as that she would worry for my safety. I agree with her and that I'll miss her, but this is an opportunity for me to spread my wings and experience what it would be out in the world as well as return to a place I have a lot of connection to. She says that she doesn't agree because I travel a lot anyways so I shouldn't go on the study abroad, and that I've already been. She's pretty adamant about not wanting me to go, but included that she does not want to stop me from going and will fully support me if I decide to study abroad.

(*Note:* I know it's common for couples to worry about cheating during trips like this, but neither of us are worried about that. We believe that it is our own intentions and willpower that matter, nobody else's. This is a level of trust we have built from scratch as we both came from really awful relationships).

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I'm torn between studying abroad for half a semester and staying home. My SO doesn't want me going because she'll miss me and feel lonely. I'll miss her dearly, but this is something I'm drawn to for the historical, educational, and cultural/familial value. WIBTA if I went on this trip? ","NAH - it makes sense that she’s insecure (read: young) and nervous about you being gone for that long.

al8u6n,"Basically my ex and I were together 3.5 years. We lived together 2 and have twins boys who are nearly 2. 

We broke up 6 months ago. 

I have been diagnosed with adjustment disorder, PPD and I have anti depressants. I feel I was personally pushed. I kept giving and giving in our relationship and got nothing back which turned me into a bitch because I have nothing left to give. 

He’s a daily pot smoker. One night I ended up in hospital when I was 30 weeks pregnant with my twins while he was out smoking up with his mates. False labour. I told him to come be with me or get stuffed. I was scared. He walked in “are you happy now” with the biggest attitude. Sat on his phone until I was DCd with the all clear then I had to drive him back to his mates so he could continue smoking up. I slept in the car. It wasn’t something new to me. I slept in the car multiple times I wasn’t allowed to go with him because one of his mates said so.. he’d continually chose spots that were hard for me to walk to or houses I wasn’t allowed to go to. 

I received a grand total of 3 gifts throughout our entire relationship... 2 of which were asked for (flowers). I got him gifts or made him a card and special breakfast on any special occasion. In 2017 he spent $300 on pot for him and his mates for their 20th birthday.. on my birthday his mates came over for a bbq.. supposedly for me. Ex said he never had any money but always had money for pot or alcohol (usually $70 and up).. 

I had to spend 16 months watching him act like his kids were a pest and that he would rather be anywhere else but home... choosing his phone or Xbox than spend time with them. I watched him physically abuse one at 2 months of age because he wouldn’t stop crying and ex couldn’t go smoke pot. (It’s been reported don’t stress).. because of that I never trusted him alone with them. I took on all the night feeds and changes etc on my own. I raised these two by myself because I was too scared to ask him for help. He would generally crack the shits so I just didn’t bother. 2 weeks post c section of the twins I dragged them and myself out of bed at 4am to take ex to work..and then Pick him up that afternoon. All he did was work, come home sit on his phone and smoke. If I had to cook dinner and the babies needed a bath I’d have to ask him several times and wait for him to finish whatever he was doing on his phone (which was usually him screaming obscenities at mobile phone games)... or walking around punching and breaking things. He went through 8 phones in 3 months due to smashing them in his face when he lost his game.

He screamed at me on a daily basis especially over games. I’d be called a fucking regard, dumb bitch, stupid cunt.. you name it I was it. My cooking wasn’t cooking. Just because I cooked some meat and veg etc doesn’t mean it was cooking.. there was a time there where he actually criticised how I didn’t eat Indian “how Indians ate it”..  told me he wanted to crash the car (while he was driving I was teaching him how to drive so he could get a license) and kill us WITH the kids in the car... this happened about 5 times. 

If I asked to go out on a date because everyday was exactly the same.. him sitting on his phone, or Xbox and his mates over every single weekend smoking yo out the back I had to wait until he had enough money.. but he always had money for pot. 

We break up. 3 weeks before our wedding. Apparently I have made his life miserable and it was hell having to come home to me. Gee I wonder why. I moved back home. Instead of paying child support he was blowing $900 a month on pot, smokes, Xbox and take away for him and his mates. It’s taken 5 months for him to finally start paying properly but not before he bought himself a car. I’ve played my part. I hound him to be more involved in our kids lives and stop pretending they don’t exist when he’s home yet when he’s here he’s always posting pics painting the image that he’s such a loving and great dad. I call him selfish and a dead beat because all he thought about for those 5 months and even now is himself. 

He’s since threatened to kill himself, 3 times and have me put in jail for it, threatened to have me killed by someone twice.. now I have a court date for a domestic violence order for myself and my kids. I feel really guilty and I don’t know why.

As a result, she held up the security line for a long time.

I suggested that she step aside and let other travelers through and my suggestion was met with a few cheers.

b6x1zk,"I'm at college in the UK, so my friendship group is made up of teens between ages of 16 and 19. I'm kinda friends with a girl, we'll call her M, as we have some mutual friends. She has some form of anxiety disorder to the point where she has a panic attack every 1/2 days. From very brief discussions I know that it was caused by some trauma from a while ago. As a coping mechanism she participates in 'little culture', basically that she kinda regresses to a child like state (5 ish) and acts like a child for a period of time. She'll skip around the room, giggle like a child, move things around to make people kind of annoyed with her (she likes to describe herself as a 'bratty little') and carry around a soft toy that she refers to as her 'stuffies'. On a couple occasions she has watched TV shows for small children (teletubbies, Peppa pig, etc) on her phone at full volume whilst sucking her thumb. She talks about how she wished she had a 'daddy' (someone who 'parents' a little) who could 'punish' her. Everyone in our group is aware that she gets off to it.
The thing is, I don't care what she does at home. M is an adult, she can do what she wishes when it comes to the bedroom and in private. But the fact that she does all of it in public is embarrassing for our group as it draws attention due to the 18 year old who is hugging a teddy bear watching Peppa pig at full volume. But when I've tried to talk to someone else they call me an arsehole since she's been through traumatic experiences and this is how she copes, which makes me feel guilty for my opinions.

a6dyzu,"In March of this year, I moved down to California to start living with my girlfriend, who became my bride-to-be very soon after. We’ve had our ups and downs, have generally been happy, but one thing has come up over and over again: I’ve always felt like a total servant boy. 

Whenever we have garbage, I’m always the only one to take it out. When we have dirty dishes, they’ll sit in a pile untouched until I do them. 

I’m almost always the one who cooks dinner; and when I cook, I do it alone while she relaxes in our room, but if she’s the one in the kitchen, she expects me to be there with her to help. If I work late, I’ll always come home to find her sleeping next to an emptied UberEats bag- she never seems to cook for herself. 

I’m always the only one who does the laundry, though she does have an excuse for that one- she tells me she’s afraid of secluded, closed-off, dirty places, and so our apartment building’s laundry room gives her the creeps. That’s fair enough, so I tell her she can make up for it by folding the clean laundry- but she always procrastinates on that for days. I’m currently sitting next to a pile of her clothes that was finished on Wednesday and she has still not put away, and that’s how it generally goes whenever I ask her to. Usually, I just don’t bother asking and put it away myself, but then she will complain that she can’t find where anything is and that I did it wrong. To her credit, she once told me she feels uncomfortable about folding my laundry because she thinks I’ll just end up complaining about how she did it, and that’s completely true- though I regret it and do my best not to repeat it, I have behaved like that in the past.

And the one thing that bothers me the most is that, day in and day out, she is always telling me to get up and bring her things from the kitchen. The kitchen is only a room away, and I never ask the same of her - if I want something, I always get it myself - but if she feels like having a snack or a glass of water, the duty falls on my shoulders. I know it’s so petty, but when combined with everything else, I just always feel like she’s completely unwilling to lift a single finger and views me as a free butler.

I’ve confronted her about my feelings over this matter several times in the past, and she has a typical answer: she works 40 hours a week, more work and harder work than my own job (so she puts it), and it always leaves her tired and stressed, so she shouldn’t be expected to do so many extra things. It’s true that I don’t work quite as often - at my retail job I usually work closer to 20-30 hours per week - but she works a steady 9-to-5 office job, Monday through Friday, leaving her with plenty of spare time to do her part, whereas I’m often working late nights or early mornings on any possible day of the week, and it always leaves me exhausted. It’s gotten even more aggravating in the past month, because I’ve gotten a second job for the holiday season that has resulted in my actually working closer to 40-50 hours a week, but she still hasn’t picked up any slack.

But, really, regardless of how hard we may or may not work, the fact is that it’s not actually too difficult to take out the trash, or wash dishes, or put your dirty clothes in the laundry hamper. It doesn’t *tire* me to do them, and I accept them as just the natural duty of anyone who lives in a home. It doesn’t bother me that I have to exert the energy. What bothers me isn’t the labor, it’s feeling like I’m being treated as an unequal partner in this relationship, who’s saddled with all the extra chores because I have less value. Sometimes, she will add the extra excuse that she is burdened by her anxiety, depression, and ADHD- which hurts, because I have all those conditions too, but I still find the energy to do what needs to be done. It feels like yet another way of saying that my feelings matter less even if they’re the same feelings as her own.

This problem has ended up starting fights more and more over the past few months. She’s now sometimes apologetic toward me when she asks me to do something, but hasn’t actually started doing more work herself. She grew up in an abusive home, and sometimes I see her shrink away or go silent when she sees I’m upset- it always makes me feel like a total jackass. Am I wrong for expecting more from her? Is her tougher work life enough for me to be reasonably expected to pick up all of the housework?",NTA. She lives there too. She needs to be pulling her own weight. ,"NTA. Not even a little.

ajiz90,"My (34m) parents retired to someplace a few thousand miles away from me several years ago, so they only see me and my kids (11 &amp; 14), on special occasions every few years. My parents had the idea that this summer they would like to rent a vacation home for the whole family (my parents, my brother and his wife, and me &amp; the wife and kids) to all have a family vacation together.

My parents said they would pay for the accommodations for everyone, so we only had to pay for our transportation. 

I told them I thought this was a great idea, and we would be happy to come. However, I also told them that when we travel, I insist that wherever we stay hads enough bedrooms that each of my boys can have their own room. That would mean for all of us staying in one house, a 5 bedroom house would be required. I also said that if finding a big enough place was outside of their budget, I would gladly contribute to the cost of the accommodations.

The kids having their own rooms is very important to me. They don't get along with each other, and sometimes they just need some space apart where they can be separated. My youngest also can be very hyperactive at times, and when he doesn't get a good night's sleep (which he won't, if he is sleeping on a couch in a living room), his behavior is terrible the next day. When we travel, if they don't have their own space, it always ends up being a frustrating, stressful, and unpleasant experience for all of us.

Unfortunately, the next thing I heard from my mother about this trip is that they have chosen the house, and already booked it, and it is a three bedroom house. She said she looked for a bigger place, but couldn't afford it (appearently she ignored my offer to help pay for a larger place).

I told my mother I want to think about it, and may choose to just rent a separate house nearby for just us instead of staying in the house she rented.  She is very opposed to that idea, and replied that us being in a different house would ""kill the feeling of a family vacation."" I don't understand that, since we would still meet up with them everyday and spend plenty of time together.

I get very little time off of work, and I want to enjoy what little vacation time I have. I don't want to spend it in a situation that I will find stressful and uncomfortable. Honestly, I am frustrated enough that I am considering saying we will not be able to come on this trip at all. Am I the asshole here?","YTA.

cur2r0,"So my girlfriend and I have visited Scotland this month. Part of our trip included the lovely Isle of Skye. And as breathtaking as it is, we learned one lesson: Thou shalt not go to Scotland during high season. Every single B&amp;B or restaurant, how remote it may be, was full. Everyday. You can't turn your butt or you're cheek to cheek with another tourist. 

So we stayed in Dunvegan for a couple nights, which is sortof of a town. Although it is actually just one street with some houses on the side. So as it was getting late we were looking for a place to eat. Since we hadn't booked anything (we didn't even know for sure if there was a restaurant in this town), we were happy enough to find the Dunvegan hotel, aptly named: The Dunvegan. Originality points here.

Anyway we managed to get a table, which would be available in 30mins. When we got seated, my eye was immediately drawn to a particular feature present in the dining room. I soon found myself to be staring at the buttcrack of a moderately fat guy, having a greasy hamburger with his family.

Now I don't know about you, but somehow buttcracks always seem to draw attention. While I occassionally managed to look at my girlfriend or anywhere else, the crack never really left my peripheral view. It's not like I have a thing for fat construction worker butts. Perhaps it was the urge to put an icecube in there that kept part of my attention on the abyss across the room.

So after 15 minutes of trying to focus on anything else I was happy enough to see him leaving for the toilet. I figured when he comes back he will surely pull up his pants right? Boy was I wrong. As if it is the most comfortable position to have your pants in, they were hanging at exactly the same level as when he left. I was a bit impressed with how he managed to do that. I for one, should know. I also have to lift my pants more than once a day, but I counteract it with increased elevation of my underwear.

Eventually the food came (hurray!) and we started eating. But just as my girlfriend couldn't get my full attention before, neither did my food. It just wouldn't leave my sight. So after another 5-10 minutes of the mental torture of restraining myself, I decided to let him know my point of view. Since I couldn't be the only one having this view, I thought it would be in anyone's best interest.

So I stepped up to the guy and said: ""Excuse my, but you have been showing your butt for the past 15mins. Could you please pull up your pants?""

To be fair, he handled it like a champ. He just chuckled awkward and said ""okay"", after which he lifted his oversized pants. Please note, his pants were also oversized from his own perspective. 
After I said that, his family had a good laugh, my girlfriend and I had a good laugh, and if you count his nervous chuckle; he had a good one himself as well.

Still it must be quite embarrassing, and he didn't dare to look me in the eye again. My girlfriend thought it was a brilliant move, but also somewhat dickish. So here I wonder: Am I The Asshole?

EDIT: To clarify, this is not about the fact that the guy was somewhat overweight. Just trying to draw an accurate and colorful textual representation here.
Also there were about 7 other tables with guests, and 7 staff.","YTA - your preoccupation with him was your problem, not his.  It’s akin to all the folks against public breastfeeding because THEY can’t keep from looking at the breasts.

A couple of months ago I divorced my husband(m31) and I realized that the same thing happened, even though she knew the reason why I divorced him (he was unfaithful,cheat on me, and he was very manipulative) I warned her that to be careful since he was going to try to contact or add people that known  me to continue stalking

Recently (my fault for snooping) I saw that they became friends by instagram and she liked all her post.

I got upset and bothered, I wrote to her asking her what was going on and she told me that nothing, that I only have to worry about my life, I felt something betrayed because I thought she was my friend.

then she sent me screenshot where she talks with him (so i could see that nothing was happening) and in a part of the conversation she says ""you seem to be a very good boy, you dont seem to be what she tells me about you ..."" She also send her voice messages

dczqb7,"So there’s this bridge in my hometown that is legal to fish off of since it is a pedestrian bridge, has no “No fishing” signs, is over public recreational water, is in a public park, and I have a valid license. 

The best fishing spot is right up against this large pillar that sticks out in the middle of the water about 20yds to the side of the bridge. I have caught some real monsters there, and being disabled, I cannot cast far enough from the shore to reach this pillar (about 100yds from shore), so to reach this spot I have to fish on top of this bridge. It is the only really good spot in the whole area. 

Things have always been fine until recent years where tourism has boomed and boat traffic has increased. (Maybe 10 boats per hour passing under the bridge tops.) There are these large river tour boats that occasionally pass under the bridge, but they are usually loud enough that I can hear them and pull up my lines, (although by fishing right up against this pillar boats never come near my lines for fear of crashing into the pillar or the underwater debris around it). Even so, I usually avoid fishing there on the weekends or during peak boating hours. 

However, today a boat snuck up on me. Not only was this boat of 25+ tourists somehow totally silent (no engine noise, no music, no talking) but it comes right where my lines are right up against the pillar! They almost crash into it. Anyway, once I see it I pull up my line (with a large hook) as fast as I can which misses the boat (and people) by mere feet. The boat captain freaked out and shouted “Don’t fish on the bridge!” at me, but once the boat got far enough away I ignored him and cast out again. He got mad and turned to the shore and hopped off the boat and started making a long phone call. I figured he might be calling police (which I’ve talked to before and they said what I’m doing is legal), but it just wasn’t worth the hassle so I left. 

Am I the asshole here, Reddit? Do his rights to enjoy the river supersede mine? Is he responsible if someone/thing gets hurt/damaged (as the captain) or am I? I am using large brightly colored bobbers and bright fluorescent line too if that helps. I’m torn up about this.

Edit; UPDATE: today I called my local Texas Parks and Wildlife office and they said it was legal, I called a park ranger who said it was legal, I called local Police and they said it was legal, and then I called the city’s Parks and Rec Dept and they’re uneasy about it because of safety reasons, but they said it’s technically legal. They said to come in Monday to see if we can work out a plan to accommodate me and the other fishermen and the boaters. Something along the lines of adding buoys or fishing hours and whatnot. My city is known for being very accommodative of everybody’s rights to enjoy public space and waters. Wish me luck y’all!","NAH, I get why he was surprised and upset, and I understand why you're fishing in that spot(legally). Hopefully whoever he called explained to him the legality of what you're doing, and now he knows.",NAH - But I wouldn't pull up your line when the boat is close.

c9h5pc,"Yes, she is my ex-gf and we're not together anymore, but we have been getting close and spending time with each other lately. So allow me to explain...

I'm at her place Monday. We're getting high and playing drunk Uno. I initiated sex, but she turned me down because she said she's on her period.

Nothing happens Tuesday.

Wednesday, I go back to her place. Again, we get high and drink together. I didnt initiate sex this time because I assumed she was still on her period. I go home later, and then she texts me that we should have had sex.

Thursday, I go back with the intention of having sex. But she says she's too tired, so I leave.

Friday, I was done with the whole charade but she begs me to go to her place because she needs someone there to intercept a package. (I still have a key.) However, she asks me not to go into her bedroom. Of course, I do exactly that... and I find her toys out and an empty condom wrapper on the floor that hasn't been there all week.

When I ask her if she told me she was tired Thursday, only to have someone else come over, she adamantly says it's not true - despite the evidence.

She kept trying to get me to come over during the weekend, explicitly for sex. I guess to make up for what happened. But I refused out of anger.

Oh and then the following Monday, she has to go to urgent care because she has a UTI... which can be gotten from having sex and not being hygienic afterwards.

I'm not really upset that she had sex with someone else. Just that she thinks she has to lie about it. But I also think that maybe I'm blowing this out of proportion because, as prefaced, we're not together anymore.

bphh65,"So, my older sister (31) works at a big tech company in the city with a lot of gadget-happy people. I (F, 27) have recently been looking at buying an iPad, as I travel a lot for my own job and it would be nice to watch Netflix on something other than my phone.

She messaged me on Monday to let me know that someone in her workplace was selling an iPad for $100. It wasn't the most recent model but it was still in the box and had only been used a couple of times, so I said I'd take it (the culture in her workplace is pretty tight-knit, so no one would ever sell something defective).

She bought the iPad on my behalf and I said I'd pay back her the next day, when we were due to meet up for a family dinner thing. She messaged me the next morning when she got into work and said that the iPad had been stolen overnight. I asked what she meant and she said that she had left it on her desk before she went home for the evening, and someone must have taken it in the meantime.

She reported it to her boss and there was a short investigation but nothing was found (since it wasn't company property that was stolen, they didn't really give a shit). The building's internal CCTV only covers the corridors, but not the desks, so there was no way of seeing who might have taken it.

Since my sister left it on her desk and didn't think to take it home, I've been reluctant to give her the $100. She's really upset with me about this, as she and her husband have two small kids and a mortgage to pay (they're just about making ends meet, she lent me the $100 because she knew I would pay her back the next day). But my job doesn't pay that great either and I don't want to pay $100 for something that she just left on her desk. She claims that she ""didn't think it was that kind of  workplace"", but I think it was negligence on her part.

She's already gotten our parents involved. Our dad is siding with me and our mom thinks I'm a monster who is trying to steal food directly out of her grandbabies' mouths.

So, tell me - AITA here?","Of course you are NTA. You sister paid an idiot tax of $100. Tell her you never got the item you paid for, and if she was any other seller this would be fraud. If she wants to continue being an asshole, just don’t talk to her anymore.","NTA

ax7apm,"Hello, I was shown this website and subreddit by my grandchildren. My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I’ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven’t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.","NTA but what you're describing sounds like a sugar baby/daddy arrangememt, which is essentially designed for these women to take as much money as possible from you.

a9auma,"My wife and I go to bed together each night together and get up at roughly the same time. She is an expat and messages her brother through Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. On the rare occasion he is free to play games with her and talk to her on skype. Because of the time difference between her and her brother (7 hours) it can be difficult to arrange these sessions.

I'm more than happy for her to spend time with her family, I'll leave her to it and do my own thing for 2-5 hours while it happens. I understand how hard it is for her living away from her family and she needs to keep that relationship with them strong.

My problem is this - sometimes (not every time) she wants to spend all night playing with her brother, and when I've told her I want to go to bed at the same time as her and ask her to stop playing, she gets upset with me. I try to justify this with her and explain its important that we go to bed at the same time, because 1. I have a hard time sleeping if not next to her and 2. It has been expressed that going to bed at different times in a relationship can be detrimental to the relationship itself - it can spiral out of control and become a habit. She doesn't appear to agree to these points and tells me that she thinks the 'situation itself' is shitty.

I've also talked to her about creating a schedule with her brother, so that once a week or fortnight I can sleep in the spare bedroom and leave her to do her own things, but after telling her this she tells me that her brother is quite spontaneous and her gaming sessions with him don't have any decent notice of time. (I normally say that this is his problem and he's the one that needs to sort himself out).

&amp;#x200B;

Am I the asshole? Should I loosen up and leave her to it? I don't like the idea of being controlling which I know I can be sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for the responses, I can see I am the Asshole. Tonight I've spoken to my wife and I am sleeping in the spare bedroom so she can spend tonight with her brother. Going forward I will do my best to chill the fuck out and let her do the things she should be able to do without me governing her like a tyrant.  Good night! :)

You're an adult. You don't *need* your wife to go to bed at the same time as you, you just want her to. Unless she is playing video games loudly where you're trying to sleep, you shouldn't be telling her to stop playing with her brother. Let her regulate her sleep time as she wants.","YTA.

ducspm,"My fiancée Cara and I are getting married next year and we are in the middle of wedding preparations. There are some things she wants for the wedding that we are not doing to stay within our budget and she’s not too happy about that but she understands the situation.

What she doesn’t know is that I have an extra $20K savings in a joint bank account with my best friend Mia. We set that account up years ago when we started working, I always ran out of money from impulsive buying so Mia suggested we get a joint bank account where we both need to sign for withdrawals, so we can't take money out of the account for impulse buys. We put in a fixed amount of money every payday and now we have $40K in that account. It’s separate from our own individual savings, which Cara knows about.

I don’t know what I’ll do with the $20K but right now it just feels good to know that I have that money available if I ever need it. Mia and I haven’t talked about what we’ll do with the account of when we’ll get our money out, we both just want to keep putting money in there for now.

If I tell Cara about the money, I know she’ll want to use it to have the things she wants that we are doing without in the wedding. But personally I think that we’re spending enough money already and we can do without more flowers or better decors.

My niece and nephew live far away on the east coast. They are summer babies but I like to wait till Christmas to give them their birthday presents. I make a joke and say: “happy belated birthday!” with my wishes and I give them both their presents at once. 

BTW my birthday is December 28th, so growing up I never had a birthday separate from a holiday....it was always an amalgamation of the two when it came to presents and wishes.

Edit sorry when I say “far away” I should be specific that I live in Ohio....but it is still a 12 hour drive.","YTA, send the birthday presents together in one package during the summer.

eoc0o9,"Throwaway because some people included are on reddit. I'm having my bachelorette party in April. Right now it's all my bridesmaids and my MOH. So it's a total of 6 people including myself. The trip is in Florida and Thursday thru Sunday. We rented a great home away and have 3 bedrooms as we don't mind sharing a room with one other person. My one friend is dating a girl whom I get along with great. She's obviously invited to the wedding and we hang out together as double dates fairly often. She mentioned something about coming to the bachelorette party to DD for us and how fun it would be. I didn't really say anything at the time and just talked about how excited I was for it. 

It's a few days later and now I'm wondering if I would be considered the asshole for not inviting her to my bachelorette party? It's not a couples thing obviously and I'm not entirely sure where she would stay as we planned the rooming situation already. Also it's not any of my other friends that are coming, it's solely my side of the bridal party. So reddit, AITA?",NAH. I would just explain to her you are only having the wedding party and the plans had previously been set. Pretty common to only invite the wedding party.,"

dboz3u,"This will be a little poorly written as I am still angry &amp; on Mobile.

Me(22) &amp; my daughter(4) moved into a house one year ago with a woman(23). We will call her F. 

Little bit of background on F, she never lived outside her parents house.

We moved in to a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom 4-plex together at an excellent price of $1000 a month not including utilities. As F was single, quiet and respectful, I made thepoor choice of telling her that I was okay with her only paying half of rent. I would cover all utilities as my daughters taking up the 3rd room. I own all the furniture in the house, all the dishes, decor, tv, everything. 

Forward 1 month. It is now winter in Canada, negative 20 degrees celcius. F now has a boyfriend, who we will call M, that stays over sometimes. No problems until the first Hydro bill comes. It's a whopping $600. Turns out, they had her window open the entire month and the heat blasted. I confronted her over text, she didn't seem to care &amp; continued to leave the window open thought winter without offering to help with cost. That was the first red flag. 

Forward about 8 months. Its summer. I pay $700-800 a month with all utilities. Since January, M has decided to take it upon himself to move in. No discussion with me was had. Sleeps here 7 days a week. His belongings, clothes and such, are here. He takes up two parking spaces with his car and street bike. He would live in his parents basement otherwise. They are still paying half of rent, $500. I still choose to just keep my mouth shut to avoid issues. Things get worse. F and M are fully aware that my 4 year old is awake and will have loud sex while we are upstairs in my kids room. I confront over text that this is not okay. They continue. They shower after every session, racking up 3 showers a day sometimes. I shower once every 2 days, my daughter with me.


Move on to now, as it has just about been a year since moving in, I feel I should be asking F and M to be paying half of the utilities, as I do not believe it's fair that I am paying for not one, but two adults to live here. Even if it was just F, as 2 adults, we should be splitting it. 

I bring it up. Que explosion. ""There's no way we use more energy than you &amp; your kid!"" ""50/50 is so unfair"" They raise voices at me, saying all sorts of hurtful things. I try to stay calm but I did say some pretty hurtful things as well. 

Their entire argument was based off the fact that I have the whole house while they get one room. They continue the argument with the fact that a year ago we 'agreed on $500'. I tell them a year has gone by and I don't believe it's fair anymore. F goes on to say that M will stay at his parents from now on. I say that's not the point and that I still don't want to be paying for her share of energy use.

I basically told them that they can either pay half the utilities or move out. They are still arguing it. 

I'm unsure of what the outcome will be, but AITA?","NTA get a lawyer, that's a toxic living situation.","NTA. They are using more than their fair share, it’s only right that they pay for their portion of utilities.",0,0
avagug,"My boyfriend and I went out tonight for drinks in mild celebration of me finally landing a steady job after a few months of no luck and getting continually down on myself. 

Everything was going fine, I was pacing myself with no shots as I’ve realized shots can be a problem for me and he took shots as he usually does. The topic comes up that he gets very defensive about, a very silly subject mind you and I point out how’s he’s quick to point out when I get defensive about silly things... enough drinks were had and the tab was paid and I was annoyed that he was being argumentative about something so silly when we have laughed about me getting the same way so I got up and walked towards home with him behind me. 

I tried to talk about it on the walk home but he was already hiccuping and repeating himself so I dropped it and stormed ahead. His things are at my house including his laptop he uses for work because we basically live together despite him having his own room in another apartment. I went inside and closed the door and he was too drunk to realize he had the keys so started calling and texting from outside to open up. 

I opened the window and tried to talk and admittedly in my own anger and drunkenness said to him hiccuping “just admit you’re drunk and I’ll give you your things” 

He said fuck you you stupid bitch so I tossed him his keys, told him to go home and I’d give him his things in the morning. 

Since then I have been met with a barrage of calls and texts calling me names, threatening his company on me for keeping his laptop and just repeating “fuck you” 15+ times in a row.

But if its on me I don't bother, food doesnt taste differently because of how it was cut up.


We just got done having breakfast where beforehand GF asked me to butter her toast while she ran to the bathroom. I did hers and then mine and tore both in half to add to the plates.

Me (30s/f)

Adam (30s/m)

My parents, 60s m/f

Fred (Adam's father, 60s m)

Billy (20s/m)

------
I work in a heavily male dominated industry (think banking/law/engineering).  My parents and their long time friend, Fred, work in the same industry but in a different capacity than I do.  For simplicity's sake, I'll say that we are all in the Teapot Industry, and my parents and Fred are Professors at the University of Blackacre School of Teapot-ology; and that I am an associate at the very elite teapot design firm of Goldman, Cravath and Facebook LLP, or GCF.  Adam worked for a short time (less than a year) in the Teapot industy at the US Agency for Teapots about five years ago and decided it wasn't for him.  This was about five years ago.  As far as I know Adam was looking in to going back to school for something completely different.  


Recently, a low level admin job in my office opened up.  I asked my parents if they knew anyone, and they recommended Billy, who is the son of someone in the same social group as them and Fred.  Adam heard that I had hooked Billy up with an interview at GCF and messaged me about it.  I get that it's awkward to offer a job to a random person and not someone closer, but Billy was a match for a vacancy and Adam wasn't.

I explained this to Adam.  His response was that I should quit my job, take the admin position, and free up an associate slot for him.  And no, he was not joking. 

Adam's skills are stale, he doesn't know anything about teapot design, there are many well qualified teapot designers lining up to take my spot if I quit GCF, and that's not how hiring works.  I tried to explain this to him, but I'll admit I got heated.  He argued with me, and insisted he was better qualified because of his experience at the Agency and his schooling.  I ended with saying That he was delusional if he thought he was GCF material and I would never recommend him for anything after he insulted me like that. 

My parents heard about this and want me to apologize.  They understand I was insulted but say I took it too far, and that I hurt Adam and damaged their relationship with Fred.  I am sorry they are hurt, but there is no way I'm going to apologize to Adam.

AITA?",NTA - You are under no obligation to refer anyone to a position.  The fact that Adam thought insulting you was a good way to increase his chances at a position is just sad.,"NTA. OP is 007 and that's hella cool.

7p2va5,"Quick recap. Dad wasn't greatest dad, but still pretty good. The older I got the more I hated going to his house. One day I was actually happy to be there and said something I thought would make him happy. 

He didn't appreciate it. Started yelling at me, right into my face. And told me to leave. So I did. That was a little under 4 years ago now. He's attempted to get into contact me with. I want nothing to do with him anymore.

Now my dad's side of the family wants to see me, and I have no problem with that, because I really do miss all of them. But I know, that they think I should forgive him. Which is something I'm not even going to consider. 

They've asked to see me a couple times. And both times now I've said no. Because I know seeing them, means my dad is going to show up. Because to my dad, he did nothing wrong, and thinks he can repair this. He's the type of guy to use others to try to get to me. As in my grandparents, my uncle, my apparently ""very sick"" grandma, who when we went over go see her, she wasn't even home, and he was there. 

He also used my little step sister and brothers, claiming they missed me. The oldest one was 4 when I left. When I saw her recently (like 2 years ago now) she didn't seem to recognize me. 

He also messaged my uncle on my birthday saying ""all your cousins wanna see you on your birthday, can we please see you?"" 

""We"" ....which means he's going to be there.

And I love that entire side of the family, but the 2 times I did talk to them, all I got was how I should forgive him, and how I should be able to look past it. I know seeing them means talking about my dad, which I don't want.

So my main question, AITA for keeping away from that side of the family?



Edit: just thought I'd throw this in here about my dad. A couple months ago he messaged my uncle, trying to get in contact claiming my grandma was sick. He worded it to make it sound like she might die. 

So I went to my grandma's to see her. She wasn't there, instead he was there alone. She had gone out for the day with one of my aunt's. While apparently ""very sick"". While there with my dad he told me about what has happened in his life recently. 

Now please bare with me, because as I'm typing this out, it honestly doesn't sound like something someone would say.

He told me about how he got in a huge fight with his ex-wife (my step-mom) and even burned down the house they were. (He had a braggy tone while telling me this) he told me about how he now has supervised visits with his other kids.

 How in court while they were trying to prosecute him for burning down the house , they were ""wrong for trying to blame me, they thought they could make the charges stick"" 

He told me this right after bragging about burning down his house and ""going crazy and losing it"" (his words)

Just thought I'd tell you guys this so you have a little more information about why I don't want to see him.

EDIT EDIT: Another fun story, for my 14th birthday I asked for one gift from him, a party with all my family. That was all I wanted and I asked him for that for my birthday gift.

The day before my birthday my mom drops me off at my uncle's house where he was, and when I asked him ""so is the party tomorrow?"" He said no.

Instead, he told all my little cousins, we were going to chuck e. Cheese on my birthday. To celebrate my birthday.

So on my birthday, I spent it at Chuck e cheese with a bunch of little kids. My dad claimed they ""came to celebrate your Birthday"" they didn't even know it was my birthday.

Icing on the cake? My step-mom texted me, saying to look happier, because my dad told her I didn't look happy. 



EDIT EDIT EDIT: one last thing, one weekend I was at his place, and on that Sunday my friend had his birthday party. So I asked my dad on the Sunday if I could go to my friends birthday party. He started yelling at my face about how my mom gets me all week and how he only see me during the weekend, and how this is his time, and I can't go because it's his time. And after yelling at me, he went to sleep. I didn't even talk to him the rest of that day because he just slept all of it. IIRC I was 12 during this. ","&gt;said something I thought would make him happy. 

Which was what, exactly? I feel like that's kind of an important detail.

buvtkj,"
I just got home last night from a 9 day mission-type trip to central America to help underserved people. This was part of a club that I am with at my Univeristy and there were a group of us that went. 

About a month or so before leaving, the leader of the group had asked me if I had a ride to the airport, cause the airport is 2.5 hours away from my town and apparently I was the only one not carpooling there. I had planned to take a shuttle which costs $45 each way, but the leader offered to let me ride with her and one other person to avoid having to shell out more money towards this trip. I accepted and made sure to let her know that I could help pay for gas and parking.

The day of the trip, I carpooled down with them and they didnt plan beforehand where to park or look for cheap parking so they ended up parking at the airport terminal where the daily max is $27/day. I didnt have a say in where they parked as they dropped me off with our bags of supplies to wait for our group while they went to find parking. 

Fast forward 9 days later. We arrive back at the airport ready to go home and instead of riding back with them, my boyfriend wanted to come pick me up. So I told them before I left that he was there to take me and I didnt need a ride. I also told them to send me a venmo username and I'd send money for gas.

While I'm on my way home, I got a request for payment of $60 for parking and gas. At first I was kind of offended and shocked. I thought it was a bit rude to request a specific (possibly excessive) amount of money from someone that offered to pitch in, but also $60 for essentially a ride to the airport seems excessive when I could've paid for a one way shuttle for $45. I feel like it's kind of my responsibility to help pay for the parking aspect as well since I said I would, but also I'm annoyed that they didnt plan ahead and ended up going to a way overpriced garage because it was the first place they found and I didn't get to have a say in it and didnt really have a choice. 

When it comes down to it, if I need to pay the $60 then I will. But I'm tempted to just send $40 because that's what I feel like is a justified amount for my part in this. 

I may or may not see this person again. Maybe in classes, but I dont really care about that. If I decide to do this trip again in a year then I'll likely be seeing her/them again. 

Doing the math, they likely are asking me for less than 1/3rd of what they're paying for parking alone. Am I an asshole if I passive aggressively venmo $40, or should I just pay the $60 to be on good terms with them? Should I ask how much parking ended up being first?","YTA.

Assuming they got charged the daily max rate (and they probably did), You're being asked to pay for LESS than 1/4 of the total charges on parking and gas.  There were only 3 people in the car, so they're cutting you a major break.

Pay it.  Take the shuttle in the future or be very clear up front about what you're willing to pay.","YTA. 

&gt;  I accepted and made sure to let her know that I could help pay for gas and parking.

bdmgqg,"To tell the truth I don’t have a life lol my life is college. Anyway a family friends daughter has prom coming up this weekend and she desperately needs a babysitter for the night. I told her I could watch her child.  She’s a new mother at 17 so she can’t really do fun stuff anymore. Her senior prom is her chance to finally get out and have fun. We were talking earlier and she was thanking me for volunteering to babysit. She jokingly made the comment “it’s so nice you don’t have a life so you can watch my baby”.

e19mpv,"So I teach swim lessons for kids, and the class I primarily teach is geared towards 4-6-year-olds who are ready to learn how to swim, and the end goal for my level is for the kids to be able to swim on their own for about 5 yards.

There is one girl, we'll call her Nora, who is 9 years old and in my class. Which does happen, as some kids that age just don't know how to swim yet and need to be in the lower levels to get started. So the first few lessons, I note that Nora is pretty scared of swimming. When I take her out kicking to the flags, even when I hold onto her, she'd close her eyes really tight and grip onto my arms instead of the kickboard if she felt like she was going to go down.

After a little while, I spoke with my boss and it was clear to me and the other instructors that Nora wasn't getting anywhere. What made matters worse was that her parents spoke to my boss after Nora's sister had been moved up from the level 1 class to my level 2 class. They basically told my boss that Nora shouldn't be in the same class as her sister because they feared Nora would become upset. Nora definitely wasn't ready to move up to the next class, but we couldn't just pretend like Nora's sister wasn't ready for the level 2 class either. So now the pressure was on me to get Nora to swim on her own and move on. I figured out some little steps in my head to get her started for next lesson.

Long story short, it ended up being a disaster. She was never in any real danger whatsoever, but she was absolutely terrified. I would hold her by my side a few footsteps away from the wall and tell her, ""Alright, you're gonna scoop and kick really hard to the wall now, okay?"" And she would dig her nails into my arms and refuse to let go, refuse to do a few scoops and kicks and make it to the wall. She was yelling, yelling for her parents who were watching, and it was a sorry sight. Trying to get Nora to do a back float was the worst part of it. I was holding onto her back, saying ""Nothing bad is going to happen to you. You're going to be alright. You're doing a great job right now,"" And she just cried. She was floating, but I knew I could not loosen my grip on her because she would start to panic and the situation would get even worse.

Class ended, and by that point, I made the realization that Nora had a straight-up phobia of swimming. She ended up calming down afterward and played with toys, and was generally in a happy mood when she got out of the pool, but I just feel so torn with myself. I feel like I've traumatized Nora, but I also did what seemed to be the right thing to do and I just don't know what to think about myself right now. I've never had an experience with a kid who's got a phobia of the water before.

So, TL;DR: This girl I teach swim lessons to has a huge phobia of swimming. I tried to get her to start doing stuff on her own, which made her very upset and scared in the water. AITA?","YTA. I’ve also taught kids water skills. It’s absolutely not okay to push them beyond their limits. That does more harm than good, because now they no longer feel in control. You caved to pressure because of the parents and your boss, I get it. But you made the wrong choice.  

Don’t stress about it — you learned a lesson. Do it differently next time.","NAH - You tried something that you thought would work, but it didn't go as planned, keep trying and you can make a huge improvement in her swimming!  As a fellow instructor, you need to level set with the parent exactly what the requirements are for her to move to the next level, and explain where she currently is.  Each child develops at their own pace, and the level she's in is designed to teach her what she needs to know (age has nothing to do with it).

&amp;#x200B;

Focus on the basics- getting her comfortable with floats with you as support -&gt; lifejacket as support -&gt; her doing it herself.  For the kicking, give her a lifejacket + noodle -&gt; lifejacket -&gt; noodle -&gt; short distances by herself to you/the wall (bonus if you have a pool where she can touch/tot dock).  Same thing with her glides.  Once she's comfortable with the basics, then work on the arms and swimming by herself.  It might seem counter-intuitive but going back to the basics will yield a HUGE improvement in a faster amount of time.

EDIT4: Since i can’t reply; this coworker being late does indeed effect my work. I work in Physical Therapy and my office gets a huge caseload of patients on the daily. Anywhere between 8-10 patients an hour and it’s just me having to mange all of them. This becomes increasingly frustrating only because I’m unable to give the patients the care they need. I’m forced to work quickly rather than efficiently. I’m literally doing the job of 2 people by myself. If this was a cushy office job or something that doesn’t put peoples health at risk I wouldn’t give two fucks if someone is late. But when said person is late, and forcing our patients to receive care that is less than par then I care. I have done some reflecting and do realize I was going about it the wrong way completely and to those saying “just come late to be like her” I don’t run like that. I don’t sacrifice my integrity as a worker to spite my boss. My coworkers purposely park at alternate side parking places (from a certain time you can’t park there due to street cleaning) effectively getting 2 lunch breaks because they take 20-30 mins (one time this particular coworker took 45 minutes and came back with food). I was TOLD to do this by my coworkers to get an additional lunch. And I refuse. I know I’m a damn good worker and my coworker is acceptable at best.

EDIT5: This is an hourly paid job not salary (someone asked in the comments but I can’t reply cause I’m banned). As I said, after self reflection I did decide to give her a regular gift, just a little bit late because I’m still trying to be petty and passive aggressive. I will however start implementing talking to my boss EVERY time this person is more than 15 minutes late. Yes. I’m THAT guy. 15 minutes is literally nothing. Fuck even 30 minutes once or twice a month who gives a fuck. But when it’s every day, for 3 years, and NOTHING has been done?","YTA.

&gt;I have no intention of getting both gifts by the way. It’s one or the other I don’t want them to think of this as a joke gift but rather a “fucking get to work on time” gift.

A ""Fucking get to work on time"" gift isn't a gift, it's an attack.

chkxkz,"For reference, I do Hospitality in school. It's one of my senior subjects. I am not the only person in my friendship group who does Hospitality, but I'm the only one in my friendship group in that particular class. I have never asked the friend in question for food. I refuse to share food. I have germaphobia to in a decently intense way. I won't touch other people, I won't go on trains or public transport, I wipe my seat down in class before I sit on it and I go shopping with rubber gloves on. I know that unusual, but it's a fear of mine - similar to how people are scared of spiders (you wouldn't expect someone who is scared of spiders to suddenly not be scared of spiders; I'm getting help and I'm slowly making progress). It sucks, but I can't help it besides going to therapy and trying to be better.

&amp;#x200B;

This situation happened earlier today. I had made a burger in class. The burger was Mexican themed (bringing the flavors of Mexican food to a burger) so the burger obviously had Quac and Salsa, which as soon as I bite into it, went everywhere (inside the container; I wouldn't be caught dead with something on my uniform). My friends constantly have a thing where they ask me for food. Whether it's food from catering or food from the tuckshop, they ask me daily. They have full meals packed for them every day; they just want more. I used to be okay with buying them food on the condition they paid me back (they aren't poor; the people in question are given Gucci bags for good grades) but they NEVER pay me back. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had my food and I was eating it. As I was eating MY FOOD my friend looks at my food and whips her hand out. I was holding one of the burgers (there were 2) with one hand and the container with the other; I couldn't have just whipped out of the way and she was fast. She had previously been dipping her fingers into other foods and licking them so I know her fingers were disgusting for a fact. She licked her finger clean and said ""Ew, that's so gross"". I turned around, walked straight to the bin and threw it out. She was screaming at me and I just turned around and said to her ""you ruined it with your fingers and you said it was gross, what else was I supposed to do? You clearly didn't want it"" She started trying to stutter out a response but I just went to the tuckshop to get more food. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before anyone comments, she knows about my fears. She knows why I don't share food. She also knows I'm on a high-calorie diet and that seriously fucked up my eating schedule (I get everything sorted out ahead of time with my Hospitality teacher) and she did not apologize. In fact, she demanded I apologize to her. I think I'm in the right, but she doesn't. Our friends don't wanna get involved so what do you think reddit?","NTA. Even putting your fears and your germophobia aside, it's incredibly disrespectful to stick your finger into someone else's food. She needs to learn boundaries.

atlouy,"My wife and I have been married for 10 years. We met in college, and she has been my best friend for almost 14 years now. She is beautiful, supportive, kind, classy, and all around amazing as a wife. 

We went through a really rough patch about a year ago, mostly due to issues on my end. However, she told me she was pregnant. I was overjoyed. She told me she would only keep it if I was 100% in on the baby and the marriage, I said I was fully committed, and we kept the baby.

As time went on, I became increasingly insecure about whether or not the baby was mine. I did the math and thought it was unlikely it was mine, on top of having a gut feeling. I was internally agonizing over this for months, and after the baby was born, I could barely even hold him because I was so convinced he wasn't mine.

I told my wife I wanted a paternity test. She was upset but told me to get one if it would ease my mind. The test comes back two weeks later and it says I am not the father.

I'm absolutely livid. I had an out of body experience. I stormed into our house and just let loose. I felt like I couldn't stop myself, I was completely broken in that moment. I cried and screamed and asked her what I did to deserve this. I absolutely never laid a hand on her.

The whole time, she's just sitting on the couch, trying to comfort the baby. This made me even angrier for some reason, so I kicked her out right then and there. Told her to pack her bags and just get out.

She calls me the next day and tells me that I deserve to know that the baby is mine, and asks me to get a paternity test from another company. I figure I have nothing to lose at this point, and another paternity test can only help me in a divorce, so we get one at the company she suggested, and I sent a third to another company, just to be sure.

I get the results from one and they say I am the baby's father. I wait a few days and don't say anything, then get the second set of results, also confirming I'm the father. I feel like the weight of the world has just been lifted off my shoulders and I can finally be the dad I want to be.

I call my wife to give her the good news and she tells me she's not moving back in. She says she's disgusted with how I acted by asking for a paternity test and my reaction to the false one. She tells me I can come see my son, but she will be filing for divorce.

I don't think my reaction was over the top for a man who thought he was being lied to about one of the most important things. I never showed any sort of violence and I was so emotionally broken at that point. I know how it must have looked to her, knowing that I was the father, but I don't think she's seeing it from my perspective. I'm planning on discussing it with her later and trying to convince her to work on it with me when I go see my son. AITA for reacting in this way to what I thought was an enormous deception?","YTA

I went back into work and wanted to arrange for her to get a ride to my house from my grandma, who lives an hour and a half from where her accident was. I work 2 and a half hours away from where she got into an accident so it would’ve been a while for me to get there and comfort her, so I thought this was the best option because without my grandma picking her up, she’d have to go to her house and be alone because I’m not allowed to drive past midnight due to a DUI.

So I was stocking shelves the other day when a mother and her children came into the isle I was working in. After a little bit her little girl looked up at me, waved and said hi to me. I smiled back and said hi. Then she asked me what my name was, and after I replied the mother looked down at the girl and said ""how many times have I told you not to talk to strange men?""

3l26ub,"Some time ago, I'm in an elevator which contains two other people I don't know.  I was the last to get on.  Then, this really obese dude gets on.  Then, this light comes on that says ""capacity warning"".  The doors stays open for a suspiciously long amount of time.  Fat guy ignores it, and the two guys who got in first look worried, but aren't going anywhere.  I start to get out and say ""It's no problem, I can get the next one.""   The fat guy says ""Don't worry about it, just push the button again and the doors will close.""  Clearly it's happened to him before.   I tell him ""I'm sorry, I don't want to ride an elevator that is warning me that it's about to break."" and slide out.  (When I said ""sorry"" it was not sincere, rather, it was more with a tone of ""*sorry, pal*""...the way people say it when they aren't even considering being sorry.)

So obviously, he caused the problem and should have gotten out.   But he didn't.  I'm willing to believe he's ridden that elevator before with that light on.  But I'm not willing to gamble on the idea that it'll be fine this time.  I know he's an asshole for causing the problem and expecting us to deal with it, but am I also the asshole for fat-shaming him by making the problem a bigger deal than it had to be (maybe)?

d27ww9,"Let me just start off and say I think cheating is deplorable.

I have two brothers, John (28) and Matt (25).

Around three years ago, our family exploded when it came out that Matt was having an affair with John's fiance. A fiance who was 6 months pregnant. Matt turned out to be the father.

John was understandably humiliated and angry. I was fully on his side.  I was disgusted with Matt and the fiance.

Here's my issue though. At John's insistence, Matt has pretty much been excommunicated from our family. He isn't allowed at any gatherings where John is. And John purposely makes sure he is at every one. 

Matt married John's ex-fiance and are raising the 2.5 year old together.

To this day, Matt's wife is referred to as a whore and the baby is called a bastard. Only by John but in our family's presence. He hates them with a passion even today.

My parents have really struggled with this but have agreed to follow John's rule of no contact with the wife or baby. Even contact with Matt is done in secret.

Matt has been kicked out of our family business because John can't be in the same room as him. All photos of Matt have been hidden in the family home. No gifts have been given to Matt's child at all.

Am I absolutely crazy to think that three years of this is enough? 

Matt is clearly remorseful and has apologized many times in tears. He clearly regrets hurting our brother.

I can understand that John is absolutely hurt and it must've been the most painful betrayal.

But I still love both my brothers. Matt did a shitty thing but how much more does he need to be punished?

My poor parents have been broken hearted for the past three years because of this. They have confided in me that they are willing to forgive Matt and move on and regret letting it get this far. We were such a tight knit family before.

But I'm really worried that suggesting forgiveness with John will cause a massive fight and he'll make us choose between them. I also worry about his mental health.

There also the innocent child in this. He deserves a relationship with his grandparents and his aunt.

I have recently been visiting Matt and his family. They are clearly struggling with the isolation. His wife broke down and apologized as I held my nephew for the first time. My heart tore in two.

AITA for wanting to bring them into our family again and forgiving them? There is family reunion coming up in a week and I want them to attend.","YTA. Why should he “get over it”? I mean really you feel bad for Matt? Matt is living with the consequences of doing one of the worst possible things he could have to your brother. He wants to approach John and beg for forgiveness thats one thing, but you don’t get to demand that Matt is allowed back in","YTA if you invite Matt and his wife without even discussing it with John. Three years is nothing when it comes to healing from that kind of betrayal. You guys (without Matt and his wife) need to sit down and talk to John about how he is feeling. Maybe he needs therapy to properly move on.

However, you can't be expected to ignore Matt forever and I understand your wanting a relationship with him.

You ask how long Matt should be punished. I ask you, how long should John be punished? Because you don't seem to appreciate the suffering he is going through. At least we can say that Matt caused his own suffering. Not the same thing for John at all. John forever has to live with the fact that his own brother AND the woman he was going to marry had a child together, married, and humiliated him in front of the people he cares about the most. Be there for John. Research and suggest therapy for him and the whole family (not yet including Matt - at least not at first).

As for Matt and John's relationship, I think everyone needs to come to terms with the possibility that it is forever damaged beyond repair. I mean, I know that Matt and his wife are crying and penitent now, but I suspect that has more to do with them having to suffer the consequences of their actions and not because they are truly sorry for what they did to John. Matt not only slept with and impregnated his brother's fiancee, he MARRIED HER too. So she's always going to be around as a source of pain to John. Matt needs to accept that by marrying her, he likely chose this woman over ever having any kind of relationship with John.

Me: 23F

Her: 20F

We met in college, we were the same degree. She was always a little bit shy, she seemed to not really feel comfortable being around everyone. I was nice to her, and I would say we we became friends not long after we met. 

About four months after I meet her for the first time I stumble upon her reddit account. She posted something on the college’s subreddit about our shared major, so I did a little snooping and found a post of a picture of her. I thought the snooping would be harmless, but I was quite wrong. She had made several posts regarding her poor mental health, how she felt like she had no friends, stuff like that. I had originally planned to mention that I found her on reddit the next time that i saw her, but after seeing that I didn’t feel like that would be okay at all. 

After seeing all her posts about her friend problems I went out of my way to address the problems she was having with herself, but in a way that made it seem like I was just being friendly. I offered to take her to the gym, complimented her a bit more, just stuff I would do with her anyway but more emphasis on showing she was appreciated as a friend and person. This seemed to help, and she’s been doing great for a while now. 

Fast forward a year and I just randomly remembered that I knew her reddit account. I hadn’t looked at it since I found it originally, so I decided to take a look just to see how she was doing. 

She was definitely more confident in herself. So confident, in fact, she had taken to doing amateur porn on several subreddits. She started a few months ago with just bikini pics and the like, but her most recent post involved her completely naked, masturbating. Her full body, including her face is visible. 

I have no problem with girls doing porn. But my friend has been prone to not really think about the consequences of her actions. I’m proud of her for being confident in herself, I just want to make sure she’s thought this through. But there’s no way I can talk to her about it without exposing that I know about her reddit account, and her posts about not having friends are still on there. Those were definitely not supposed to be seen by people close to her. It feels like an invasion of her privacy. 

I’ve kept quiet about it for a week now, but I can’t help but feel awful for not saying anything. Am I being dumb? Or am I an asshole for not saying anything about some very risky behavior?

She's been dating Cameron for about a year, a guy who I know independently of Trisha because he and I are both performers in the same local scene.

Cameron and I were originally good friends, but 3 years ago I drastically reduced contact with him after some complaints arose about his behavior toward other female performers in the scene. He caught some flack for using gendered insults and doubled down instead of apologizing when called out for misogyny. It caused a LOT of drama and Cameron was essentially blacklisted from the scene; bringing up his name will still upset a lot of people around here. Because of this, I now only see him rarely and only in the context of hanging out with Trisha.

Now some things to note. I'm a guy who's had a rough year to say the least. I've been isolated from the outside world, so I've admittedly lost weight - enough that my cheeks have sunken in, and since my skin barely sees sunlight I end up looking something like an unshaven skull. what with the dark circles and pale skin and shit.

 I'm a bit self-concious about this, since a lot of people immediately stamp ""drug addict"" or some shit, and I'd rather not be reminded of this.

I moved to a new city with my dad well over a year ago, and every time I come to visit for family events, I stay with her.

Our circle of friends often gathers for sports/games nights. One individual really likes to host- and by host I mean he offers his place for the event. He doesn't cook anything or provide anything beyond water. It's always BYOB or pitch in for pizza. This is fine- nobody is expecting a five-course meal or free booze. We’re just happy to get together to share something we all enjoy.

The problem is that his place is absolutely disgusting. I'm talking cat litter on the ground, dirty walls, dust on everything, spilled pop dried on the coffee table and wall, stuff everything- he got married like 4 years ago and half the gift registry is sitting unboxed on his dining room table, along with random other thngs he can't be bothered to put away. Place smells like ammonia cause of the cat litter, dust-bunnies the size of actual rabbits… every counter in the kitchen has empties or garbage on it. He hasn't had soap or a towel in the washroom for nearly 2 years. When I go over, I bring hand sanitizer to use after peeing, because everything in the bathroom is just gnarly and we always eat food when we hang. It's a weird situation- we thought marriage would force him to grow up and clean his place but his partner is as bad as he is. 

Everyone in the group has talked about this issue privately and we don't know how to approach it. I thought about just buying handsoap and a towel to leave in the bathroom but I fear that'll be seen as passive aggressive and also for fuck's sake, you are nearly 40- why don't you have hand towels for your guests? I get so goddamn anxious at his house I almost want to stop accepting invites, but he's a close friend and as you get older, you don't have many of those anymore.

A few of us thought it might be depression but he got really angry when I approached him with a “Hey, if you ever need to chat…” thing over beers. We've also tried to offer our places to host but he's very traditional and inists we have it as his place more often than not. I get that different people have different standards for a clean home and I don't expect polished crytsal or floors, but I shouldn't take off my shoes and then immeadly step in spilled cat littler. It's frustrating.

WIBTA if I tell him that it's fantastic he opens his door to his friends, but he's living in borderline squalor and needs to either hire a maid or clean up before he has 10 people over for football?

byboxc,"I was on the train between 2 major cities, it’s a 1.5 hour journey so obviously most people want a seat. If you buy tickets in advance you get given a seat reservation, but if you buy them at the station you don’t and you may have to stand if there’s no seats available. I’d booked a seat so I was all good. Usually when you get on the train there are little screens above each seat which say if they’re reserved but they weren’t working that day, and reservations still apply even if the signs are broken. 

Anyway, I’m on the train and this couple who’d been out shopping (had loads of bags from clothes shops) got on and sat down. A few mins later some people get on and politely ask this couple to move as they’re sitting in their reserved seats. Usually people just accept this and get up and move because they know they haven’t booked, but the guy from the couple asked to see this persons ticket to make sure it was actually their seat (wtf, who made you the ticket inspector) anyway, it was their seat and so reluctantly the couple move to some other free seats opposite myself and my partner. 

The train was filling up pretty quickly and I realised it was gonna be full, it was 5pm on a weekday so lots of commuters. A lady and her son come along, looking confused as there were people sitting in their reserved seats (this couple), they were clearly tourists so couldn’t really speak english and weren’t sure of the etiquette of how to ask for their seats. Eventually they realised that their seats were taken and so asked the couple to move, again this guy gets all rude like ffs, and asks to see their tickets. At this point everyone on the train is watching. The couple are complaining and swearing under their breath whilst getting up. The kid is just standing in the aisle looking awkward not really knowing what to do (standing a bit in the way of this guy but not massively)  and then:

HIM (rude guy to kid):  are you gonna fucking move then so I can get up

 This kid is literally like 9 years old

So I told the guy: you don’t need to be so rude

HIM: what did you just say to me

ME: I said you didn’t need to be so rude. He’s only a child and you were in his seat anyway

HIM: Oh for gods sake (walks off in a huff with his girlfriend)

They left all their shopping bags under the table and to be honest, although we noticed we didn’t say anything because he was being a dick.

When I told all this to my friend later she said that even though they were being rude it was bad of us to not tell them that they left their bags. Well I didn’t really feel like walking off after him after he was speaking to people like that so nah I wasn’t gonna tell him - karma for being an asshole.

So was I the asshole?",NTA. they had it coming and them leaving their bags was karma for being total dicks to people who paid for reserved seats.,Totally NTA. That is their karma.,0,0

bi53t5,"edit: Thank you all for your swift and unanimous judgement. I see my humour about a green plastic bag was lost (btw I found another one) but eh, I shall embrace my asshole title. May your lives be full of multicoloured sturdy plastic bags!

___

Warning: Extremely petty story.

I'm pretty ok with my assholery but I like to think that, when it comes to close family, I respect and treat them well.

I'm the eldest of 4 and my younger sister is 4 years younger than me. (we are both in our twenties)

So earlier today the younger 2 went out to take the bins, mum told us older ones to take our stuff later because there were already a lot of stuff to take down.

So it was my understanding that we would both, later, take our bins out. I had a lot of recycling to throw away. Work papers I had to sort out. There's also a recycling bin in my room and a regular rubbish bin (just 2 plastics bags, one is green for recycling)

This evening, I look for my regular bin in my room and see it's gone. I then look for my recycling bin and see it's also gone. When I ask what's happened (my younger sister and my mum are in the kitchen) my sister tells me she took it out earlier. I say when? And I ask where the bag is. She tells me she did it earlier when she took hers out and she also chucked the plastic bag in the bin. Now, I ask her if she just chucked the green bag rubbish in the regular rubbish?! (because you cant recycle plastic bags here in our regular household bins) and she tells me no, she chucked it in the recycling. Including the green plastic bag.

So I ask her why did she do it, why didnt she tell me? My mum overhears me basically not being grateful and sort of getting pissed and my sister being a great victim because she did something she wasnt asked to do and isnt getting thanks for it. Mum tells me I should be grateful. So I ask if I have to be grateful for something I never asked for and also because no one replaced my rubbish bins in my room (causing me inconvenience coz where am i suppose to put my rubbish yo?!)?

Mum tells me I've got a big mouth (it's an expression in French meaning I speak arrogantly). She says the plastic bag can be easily replaced and here here have this one (I did dig my heels in and say no i want the exact same green plastic bag! - unfortunately I only ended up with a measly blue one...)

So, dear reddit, Am I the asshole for getting annoyed at this scenario? I just got mad when I was told I had to be grateful when I never asked anyone to do this for me and it wouldnt have been a problem for me to do it. Also my recycling was locked up in a plastic green bag that isnt recyclable so I have no idea if it's just gonna get sorted and its whole content chucked into regular trash, I also lost my sturdy, bright green plastic bag that was a perfectly fine plastic bag that had many days of use ahead of itself!

So pettiness aside, should I have said thanks to my sister (and now would therefore need to say sorry)?"," YTA. And you’re correct, this is petty.",YTA.,1,1

ed8kbn,"I’m (31f) needing a different perspective on a fight I’m having with my partner of 5 years (35m). We are preparing the house to host Christmas and have my immediate family staying with us. 

 I have suffered with migraines regularly since an operation when I was 19. My GP had suggested I try this new injection and when I called they had an appointment this afternoon. I accepted it as We are both on leave but have slot to do. The medical place calls and tells me I need to bring someone as I may not be able to drive after. I ask my partner but he didn’t want to go as he wanted to get the yard work done so he has some down time before everyone arrives tomorrow. 

This made me angry and since I returned I have been moody and he said I was being passive aggressive which is true. His response is a trigger for me as I have had my ex husband and other partners not be supportive or helpful when I need them and I feel that for something that would of taken 1.5 hours out of his day was to much effort and that I’m not worth sacrificing some of his down time and I feel that I try and help him out when he needs it like picking up his cleaning week when he has to work an extra shift.

We've agreed that we won't have any visitors in OUR room until the baby is out. But my husband wants to have his parents stop by the waiting room so he can see them (before the pushing starts). I know the day will be stressful enough, so I don't want to feel like people are there waiting on me to give birth. I don't even want my own mom at the hospital until the baby is out. I told him that labor can take a full day or even longer and he's like yeah, they could just swing by for a little and come back later. He said that it's a big life event for him and he wants their support. But I'm the one going through a medical procedure, so I feel that I should be the one to say who's around, even if he thinks it's silly or doesn't affect me.

This is our first kid &amp; I don't know how I'm going to be feeling that day, so I just want to try to keep it as low stress as possible &amp; don't want him leaving me to go hang out with them (and I definitely don't want them in our room). Not sure if he was joking, but he even said something to them about how I wouldn't need to know they're there and he could just text them after the baby is out and tell them to come up in twenty minutes.

AITA for trying to dictate who's in a room I can't even see &amp; trying to prevent him from seeing his parents during an emotional day? Or is he the asshole for not respecting my wishes on how I want my own labor to go?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you for your responses. I talked with my husband and we decided that once we're settled into the hospital, if he wants his parents to swing by the waiting room (and they also want to come), they're more than welcome to. But I don't want anyone camping out waiting on me to give birth or rushing up there the second the baby is out. As a couple of you mentioned, he's there to support me, so he should have someone to support him as well.","NAH. It's up to you who you want to see in your room prior to, during, and after the delivery. I have seen lots of deliveries (am an anesthesiologist) where one or both of the parents don't want any family/friends in the room. I will admit, you are the first I've heard of who doesn't want anyone to even come to the waiting room, but you are allowed to make your desires known without being an asshole.

That being said, your husband is allowed to have his parents *STOP BY* the waiting room without being an asshole either, if they (and he) understand that under no circumstances will they be allowed in the delivery room and that he should be focused on you and not his parents... who should have left after a couple of minutes (per his assurance to you).","NAH. My advice would be don't even tell anyone you are in labour unless you want them there or to receive a million phone calls and texts asking for updates. As much as I can understand that your husband may want their emotional support on the day, you are likely to become annoyed if you know he's leaving the room to see his parents at times when you need his support.

Even if they are the most patient people in the world, I guarantee your in laws will start to become impatient and anxious awaiting the news of the birth if you have a long labour- especially if they are sitting in the waiting room. Instead of supporting and encouraging you, your husband and midwives/nurses will then spend time filtering calls from well meaning family wanting updates. Also having people in the hospital waiting may make you feel like you have to rush those first moments as a family so that you can make yourself decent for all the visitors waiting.

Try talking some more with your husband about this topic and ask if he has any fears or concerns- he may be desperate to have them around because he is scared or thinks he won't cope on the day.

All the best for your upcoming labour and birth and enjoy all those newborn cuddles.",3,3

I try to ignore him because he's always a bit tipsy when he asks and I find it a strange question to ask someone's SO.

Growing up for me was hard. I have Neurofibromatosis 1, so I’ve always looked a bit off growing up. Always bullied by other kids around my age for it. Never really had anyone close to me who I could be a kid with. Even my own cousins would pull this crap with me, and my aunts and uncles of who’s parents they were, lived by the ‘ kids will be kids’ mindset.  
  
Let’s cue to two of them I’ll call M and G. M dispite being two-three years older than me was practically always smaller than me, and has a less than good home life than I did. Which came off as he resented me, and made sure to make a point to make my life hell whenever we’d go to my grandparents for family events. Doing the typical stuff such as playing ‘hide and seek’ them just never looking for you. Crap like this lasted until him and his family moved away and I’d see him far far less, which at that point he’d just verbally try to put me down each chance he got. 
 
 
Now I’ve not been the only one he’s had issue with, he assaulted my other cousin over 5$. There’s other stories here but I’d best avoid them. 
  
G on the otherhand, the best way I could put it was she was your typical spoiled brat mean girl and just always made me feel bad and down, and she’s just not enjoyable to be around due to being the kind of person who is one: Still like that, and two: always has to one up everything and I just don’t want to have to deal with it.  
  

Now, the main question comes in, I’m starting planning my fiancé and ours wedding and we are finalizing the guest list for the invites, I’ve askes my mom and dad about this and said I would be extremely rude and a dickhead if I excluded anyone from the family, but these people have brought nothing but negativity, malice, and bad vibes in my life and I just don’t wanna deal with it, so WIBTA if I excluded them?","NTA, it’s your (and your fiancé’s) wedding, you decide who comes.

First timer and non native speaker disclaimer. 

So for the background: 
My (m,23) best friend (f,23) had Idiot boyfriends for as long as I have known her. Nothing horrible or abusive, but they were idiots. While you think that wouldn't necessarily affect me - since it's her relationship - that wasn't the case. 2 of them were incredibly jealous and it was annoying af. 

Fast Forward and my bestie is single. I thought I could help her a bit to finally get the great bf she deserves. I went through my friendslist and....well...most of them did not really fit the description she gave me of what she wanted from a bf. 
But one did (m,23). Perfectly. They are - in my opinion - a perfect match. 
Only problem: He had a girlfriend. 

I introduced them anyway. 
Subtly tho as I may add! 
I took her to a boardgame night at his place, went clubbing with them (and others), took her to play beachvolleyball with him and managed to get her to join his volleyball club. (Both of them really really love volleyball, as I said: perfect match). They instantly hit it of and started hanging out without me.
I never told him of my idea. I told her only after they were already friends. But to be fair I did talk him up a lot and always used him as a benchmark of how dudes should be.

Again fast forward a bit and his girlfriend broke up with him. They were already having a rocky relationship when I had my match making idea and broke up once before. 
After a few weeks my best friend and my friend got together.  (They did nothing other than hang out before the break up, no cheating involved)

I told all of this a friend of mine and she thinks I was a massive asshole to the ex-Girlfriend by introducing them. 
And since then I found out that, while not the primary reason, him hanging out with my best friend was a contributing factor to the fight that finally led to the break up.

I lived in a hipster liberal area. Across from my apartment in a small park where people would protest the Iraq war and Israel frequently. My friend gave me a G W Bush cutout and we put it in my window. It was very visible from the park and road.

e1pdq6,"My sister (2 years older) has always looked down upon me.  She was an honor student and I was an athlete, we both had scholarships to great colleges but I had a severe injury that wrecked all of that.  She never said it but I could just tell she was a little happy so she didn't have to ""share"" the spotlight of being the ""successful"" one.  I didn't really care about any of that cause my main goal was to go pro but that got derailed.  Thats all in the past and while I'm no longer angry or saddened by what happened its just one of many things that my sister has done that makes her just look down upon me.

I smoke weed, not a lot but I do.  My sister is a heavy no weed or anything thats ""anti-religious"" in her eyes.  She has told me on numerous occasions that ""I need to stop smoking cause I will end up like our cousin who's in jail for heavy drug use and distribution"".  

The straw that broke the camel's back tho is when I over heard her talking with her husband last christmas after she saw a couple party cups (they were perfectly fine, just plastic cups are cheaper than glass cups.  She said and I will always remember this ""I wish I had an actual good brother not this stoner fuck up"".  

After I heard that its just ran me up a wall.  For the past year I've kept it civil and even offer her a place to stay during the holidays.  I keep it civil and passable for my parents sake but once they sadly pass ill probably cut contact with her cause she clearly doesn't respect and constantly looks down upon me.

et7ry0,"I’ve been in a relationship with A for four years now. We live together and as far as I’m concerned he’s my forever person (and I sure hope he reciprocates). 

He‘s always had a terrible relationship with his family. His mother passed 10 years ago, he doesn’t interact with his father unless strictly necessary (they have bad history) and he doesn’t really get along with his sister... especially over the fact that she maintained a relationship with their father, despite some of that history having affected both siblings.
I met his grandma when she was still with us, and I’ve socialized with his sister’s family on a few occasions (and, with my parents insistence, we also had a “family” lunch where they met each other). I’ve never met his father, despite him living right next door to the apartment where his grandma used to live and where we often spent the night when visiting. 

This doesn’t really affect our day to day life, as we live and work a couple of hours where his family is located, but A and his father are in the same trade and his category has a national meeting once a year which they both attend. 
I’ve now accompanied him three times and I expect a fourth time in a few months. 
My parents now and then mention that, once we are there, I should just walk up to his father and introduce myself at some point. Whether A likes it or not, his father is my de facto father-in-law, so we should at least shake hands. I tend to disagree. I’d like to meet the man, but if A doesn’t want me to, I’d rather respect his wishes. I am positive it’s HIS FATHER he doesn’t care about and not a weird issue about not wanting to introduce ME. He doesn’t want him in his life, so he doesn’t want to “share me” with him in any way or form. 

But since I’m new to this forum I thought I’d take this opportunity to run it by the community.

e5roue,"Hello reddit!

So, my husband and I have spent the past year having our loft space renovated into a gorgeous bedroom suite with Jacuzzi tub, steam shower, giant walk-in closet, big screen tv etc etc. it’s basically a duplicate of our master bedroom suite and we love it!

My daughter, 10, has been fighting terrible bedtime anxiety for the past year. In an effort to encourage her to sleep on her own, we have set up a reward system for her. The reward she chose was to sleep in the new suite over the Christmas break. She’s beyond excited and making great progress.

Here’s the rub. My brother in law unexpectedly lost his job and my husband ended up inviting BIL and SIL to stay for Christmas. I managed to keep it from being an open-ended visit because my husband and I are both extremely busy. But even for the 2 days that they are visiting, my husband expects my daughter to give up her reward so the in-laws can use the new suite.

We have 4 other bedrooms, and they are all very nicely decorated and spacious. I feel like I made a promise to my daughter and my husband is going to break her heart. I’ve forbidden him to even mention it at this point, until we get this settled. I don’t want her to backslide!

So…AITA???

EDIT: OK some clarification. 

1)For those who are asking, my husband was aware that we were throwing around the idea of giving my daughter the loft. I don’t believe he knew that that was what we had settled on. He says he didn’t know, I honestly can’t recall If or what I told him

2) That was of you saying I have a vendetta against my in-laws are dead wrong. We don’t mesh, and never really have, but that is neither here or there

3) While texting my husband and brother-in-law regarding some Christmas details, I accidentally sent brother-in-law a text intended for my husband where I discussed the situation. Brother-in-law immediately responded that my daughter should have the room. For those of you saying I’m just trying to be a bitch to my in-laws, even brother-in-law agrees with me","~~If you displace your daughter, at that age I wouldnt be surprise if she did backslide. Especially since she earned that reward and her parents took it away all of a sudden (even though its just 2 days, thats still taking from her). It might teach her any reward you promise you'll take back. Is 2 days a big deal? Objectively, no. But is it a big deal to a 10 year old? Fuck yes it is.~~



After hearing more context, and hearing your husband wasnt told about the reward system or the reward, Im going with ESH.","I’m gonna take a different turn and say YTA, and not because of previous comments or posts you may have made. 

Your daughter could sleep in the room any other time as a reward for the same amount of nights promised. Or, start after your in-laws leave. Either way, she can still get her reward. It feels like you’re making this a much bigger deal for OTHER personal feelings towards the in-laws. When I have guests over, I give them the nicest room I have. Why? I want to make sure my guests are 100% comfortable while visiting, even if it is only for two days. 

Someone else commented that yes, two days can mean a lot to a 10 year old. To an extent, I get that. But how about her staying two extra nights in it after break, to keep your promise? Basically what I’m saying is that there are ways around TWO DAYS. If you’re not willing to find a compromise with your husband, you’re TA. Btw, SAHM here. Just because I watch my daughter all day while my husband works, doesn’t mean I’m in charge of the house. We made decisions together, maybe try that out.",0,0
bc6lmv,"So at lunchtime, my friends all do ""prefect duty"" (basically guarding the corridor to make sure no one passes). I am not a prefect and neither is another friend. Regardless, we go and hang out with the other at their post. Help them with their shit job a bit.

Anyway, one teacher *really* feels it's his job to enforce stupid rules no one except power-tripping sad old fucks care about. Everytime he sees us there, he comes and starts going ""how many of you should there beeee heerreee?"" (because there's two extra people). Most of the time, we either ignore him or just go around the corner until he's gone if he's very persistent. One time he followed us all the way up a corridor and into a room to make sure we were gone. Sometimes he calls the headteacher to help him out. I've asked him politely why it bothers him, and he could not give an answer.

So, 2 days ago, we were all standing on the post. He came to clear us out and we all (including the prefect friends) just left. Went and sat on a bench. 

Today, I was called for a lunch detention in the lunch hall (3 days worth!). I asked why, and the woman in charge of detentions told me that the teacher had said that we FOLLOWED HIM ACROSS THE SCHOOL. AND WERE YELLING AT HIM ABOUT LITTER. This just did not happen. The minute he came to us, we went. He just straight up lied. 

Me and the other friend (it was only us two in there) decided to go to his room at the end of lunch and ask him why he just made that up. He changed his tone pretty quickly and was saying we shouldn't have broken the rulleees anyway, and saying he supposedly didn't say that. I asked why he is so bothered by this and if he has genuinely nothing better to do? He threatens to report us to the head again. I ask him why he can't just deal with it himself and then say something along the lines of this being why his wife left him. The guy looked like...Absolutely shattered? I didn't think much before I said it, honestly. We left after that. Probably gonna be doing way more detention now, so it was sort of dumb.

c65t3p,"I purchased some football socks from Ebay to finish off the kit I had bought. They are official Adidas socks and arrived as new in packaging as described and looked great.

The week I received them I wore them twice to play football, and after the second game I noticed that one sock had a big hole in the sole. I hadn't worn them any differently to usual socks, and I hadn't been walking in them without shoes on so I was a little annoyed as I had expected they would last longer than two games.

As they had broken so quickly, I messaged the seller with a photograph and asked if he would provide a replacement or refund as they had broken so quickly. While he's obviously not the manufacturer, in my experience on ebay as a seller, the seller assumes responsibility for items in the same way that a store would and I presumed the pair he had sent me were simply defective.

The seller has since been very difficult and is refusing the request because the product has been used and it must have been misuse that caused the issue which is nothing to do with him. Part of his argument is how would he return them to a manufacturer when they have been worn. I need to wait a few days before I can ask ebay to look into it, but AITA for wanting the seller to reimburse me for my purchase?",YTA dude lol. You said yourself they were in new packaging. You’re being an asshole.,"

asz2dg,"First time posting on this sub, but this has been a point of contention between my sister and I and need some advice. I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.

Lo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.

Regardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it’s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they’ve been going out for roughly 6 months).

Am I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that’s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. 

TLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won’t go if he’s not included, they’ve only been going out 6 months.","YTA. Unpopular opinion so far but whatever.

It doesn't sound like the guy is violent or a criminal. I would agree with you if you were worried he would cause a fight  or scene, steal, etc etc, while there. But it doesn't sound like there is a chance he will ruin your wedding, you just don't like him.  Is it worth the relationship with your sister? 6 months is a decent amount of time of dating, it's not like one month. What if she ends up being with this guy for a while and this causes a huge rift between you? I guess it's up to you if that's worth it. ",YTA. That is really unfair.

eatd09,"So my girlfriend and I have two close friends that we normally exchange Christmas gifts with for the past 3 years. I texted them the other day asking what size they were because I was going to get them something. They told me the size and I order the gifts. Well 4 days later they group text us saying we aren’t exchanging gifts this year, knowing that I had already purchased them something. Then my other friend proceeded to say “ Bring me the gifts you bought anyways” and laughed about it. Upset I immediately went and cancelled the items I purchased online and was able to receive my money for them. Once I was able to do that I replied back to them saying “ Oops already cancelled everything.” My girlfriend said I shouldn’t of done that and should’ve given them the gifts.

eatr4d,"My (32M) brother (31M) will throw a fit if he didn’t get exactly what was on his wishlist. I’m not saying a yelling match or physical, but will get defensive and will over express his frustration. It will ruin his mood and generally puts a damper on the occasion. His reasoning is that the whole purpose of a wishlist is to get exactly what he wants. It eliminates the need to guess and try to anticipate if he will like it. 

I’m on the opposite end. I believe any gift should be taken with gratitude and appreciation. They spent time and money on something for you. That is time and money they could have saved or used differently and or on themselves. 

So am I the asshole for calling him out? He sent a text asking if he got the exact thing he wanted for Christmas and that if we didn’t , then we need to do cash. I asked him where his entitlement came from? And if we don’t get that item, should we get anything at all? He gave me the wishlist explanation from before.

b56wlp,"So I've known my buddy P the best part of 10 years . I watched him turn from a teenage apprentice to a head chef to business owner and back to sous chef after losing it all through stupid mistakes (drugs) hes now 26 this year , lives in a shithole home with his parents and 4 younger brothers (nothing wrong with the structure or the parents they just never clean up after themselves) he met a girl about 6 months ago and they are officially in a relationship. Hes changed (obviously) so now I don't see him as much and when I do it with his gf .. again not a problem she's actually quite nice.  Just in that 21 year old ""let's party"" frame of mind constantly .. anyway... 

The last 3 or 4 times I saw him he was asking me a lot of questions about kids (having had my own son at 26 under very different circumstances eg my own place in a relationship for 6 years etc etc ) so I out right asked him if his gf was pregnant he said ""no but we are going to start trying soon"" 

I told him straight ""You aren't ready for a child , you need your own space, you are in massive debt, you have only been with your gf 6 months you still have so much to learn about each other, you work like 100 hour weeks, how are you going to do that with a baby keeping you up all night "" he told me I don't know what I'm talking about  and if I can do it at 26 so can he. 

I've had to bail him out 3 times in his life due to him jumping the gun to early and I feel like hes using the thought of a baby to distract him from his current problems 

I'm just trying to protect him but I know he took it the wrong way and didn't really get where I was coming from.

chzuai,"So I’m 18 and my older sister is 26. She has a daughter who is five, and I love her very dearly, but she acts very strange at times, mostly to get a reaction.

I was babysitting her earlier today, and she sat next to me. I said hi and smiled and she just started...smelling me in the most intense way. 

I asked why she was doing that and she said she felt like smelling me. I was like okay... and then she started smelling the table, and then the couch. I figured if she wasn’t hurting herself or anyone/anything else, she was okay. Like I said she’s very odd at times so I didn’t think anything of it. 

A little bit later my neighbor came over just to say hi, and my niece continued smelling everything after saying hi. 

At one point I thought it was maybe time for her to stop so she wouldn’t break her nose or something. So I asked her to please take a break from smelling everything. Then she plopped onto the floor and smelling my leg.

I asked her to stop and she yelled at the top of her lungs “IT’S SMELLINGTINES DAY”.

At this point I was frustrated so I picked her up and sat her on the couch, and told her to calm down. I looked over at my neighbor and her face was appalled so I asked what was up and she said “That little girl is genius. Smellingtines!! Get it? Like Valentines but smelling. That’s so sophisticated.”

I told her “No, it wasn’t it was stupid. She just took the word of what she wanted to do and put it in front of tines.” 

I guess that angered my niece because she started crying and saying I called her smellingtines day idea stupid. I told her to take a nap and she did. 

By the time she had woke up my neighbor had left and her mom was there to pick her up. I helped her get ready and asked for a hug before saying goodbye and she turned her head with a dissatisfied face, saying how I hurt her feelings earlier.

e9xc3n,"Ok so this is a throwaway acc. I doubt any of my family uses Reddit but just Incase.
A little background: my uncle (35) is the second oldest of three siblings. My dad (47) being the oldest. My dad came to America in his twenties and much later brought my uncle because my uncle wanted to come live here. We come from a communist country so yeah. 

My uncle has had at least 3 wives and has cheated on all of them. Every single one, including the one who gave birth to his son.  Fast forward to 2016 ish. He’s married but he’s coming to America. His new wife (33) wasn’t given a visa yet so she couldn’t come at the same time. It took her about a year to get the visa to come. Within that year where my uncle was alone he began a series of affairs that honestly I wish I was kidding. All while He would send emails to his wife saying that he missed her etc. 

Everyone in the family knew this. Every single person and said nothing because as my mom says “it’s not our business”. To be honest I almost sent my aunt an email spilling everything to her but I was stopped from doing so by my mom and my own fear. 

When my aunt came to America, he apparently stopped. He started being faithful and coming home on time etc. Until about two weeks ago. He keeps asking for my grandad to cover for him and tell my aunt he’s working late and has been spotted with multiple girls.

Tell her you can still eat vegan without being organic. Offer to help her by looking for coupons and looking in circulars every week to find the best deal. She may have to make some sacrifices, but she can still eat the way she would like. 

If that doesn't work. I would stop giving her money for the food she wants. If you need food I would buy it for yourself. You are allowed to eat what you want. You don't have to support her lifestyle. She is an adult and she can do that for herself. I will say, don't just buy a ton of junk food because it is cheaper. That is a path that leads to a very unhealthy lifestyle. Look for deals. There are things you can get that are both healthy and inexpensive like eggs (if you are even allowed to keep them in the house), rice, beans, etc. 

I hope your mom listens to you. You are a minor under her care, she should be providing for you, not the other way around. I get that sometimes people need help and it is good to help when you can, but not when it comes down to supporting her trendy diet.",0,0
b1lakv,"So I come to the gym, I warm up, and I see 1 of 3 squat racks are empty. One of the squat racks is taken up by my friend, so I decided to work out at the squat rack next to him. My friend, we will call him A, goes to the bathroom or something and leaves his stuff at his rack. So just when I start my set, a guy comes up to me and asks 

Guy : ""Who's stuff is this right here?'
Me : "" It's my friends, A.""
Guy: "" is he squatting as well?""
Me: ""I think so""
Guy: ""Why don't you guys just work in with each other?""
Me: ""He does a lot more weight than I do, so it would be kind of inconvient.""
Guy: ""All you have to do is change out the weights man""
Guy continues to argue that I should work in with my friend

Now, I would agree with this guy, however my friend is a serious lifter and can squat more than 100 pounds than I can. Additionally, me and friend are at different heights so we would have to constantly change the height of the bar as well. This guys tone was also kind of entitled, as if  we were supposed to work in with each other from the beginning. ( I know, a little biased). 

At this point, I don't know if this is a normal thing gym people would ask each other to do, but in my 6 months of experience, this is a first for me. 

When I tried to talk to A and ask him if this was normal , the guy interrupted me and said: ""Yeah that's right, I told him that you guys should share racks. No need to hide it from me, it's not a secret."" He would then sit somewhat behind us and just stared at us until a rack opened. Me and my friend just decided to share a rack in order to avoid this guys daggering stares. So, AITA for refusing to share a rack with my friend?","NTA, this guy was kinda entitled and clearly didn't want to wait to do squats, even though he could have been doing other exercises while waiting for one of the squat racks to open up.",NTA. That guy sounds like an entitled ass. But your friend is also kind of an ass for trying to save a rack - next time your friend should finish out his set before taking a piss.,0,0
bh3vlc,"So I work at a Smoothie King. Nothing too hard, but it can get hectic when a lot of people come at the same time. We had a good rush, maybe fifteen or more people. We can also work for tips. 

The last girl in line of the rush comes up, sees there are only two people working, and says “Wow, that took a long time.”

I decided to ignore her comment and still provide excellent service. 

As the interaction goes on and she orders her smoothie, she continues with the rude attitude. Huffing and puffing when I ask what size smoothie, rolling her eyes as I asked for her name, etc. By the time that it’s time for her to pay, she looks at the credit card reader and says “Tip? Why would I do that?” in front of everyone else still waiting. 

So I decided to add three scoops of fiber in her smoothie to ensure she really enjoyed what she asked for. 

Am I the asshole?","YTA. I'm actually allergic to high dosages of fiber (the nickel content, technically) and I'll get a rash. I know it's rare, but there may be other reasons why someone can't have too much fiber. Plus, you were doing it to be a vindictive asshole. I get it, trust me, but part of customer service is to just deal with it, unfortunately lol.","ESH. Yes, she was a bitch, but tampering with people's food is **not** cool.

AITA even though she was tired?","NAH as long as you didn’t wake her up or argue with her over it. Sounds like this doesn’t happen often so it’s honestly not a big deal. Who knows? Maybe she’ll wake up tomorrow and apologize for it. No use making a big deal out of it if it’s not a common occurrence.

dob5jd,"A little background: I (18F) started working at a fast food place in the summer. My friend (19F) was in need of a job, and we were pretty short-staffed, so I asked a manager (different than the Boss)  to bring her on with the understanding she would have to leave once school started for her due to the commute from her place to the job.

Here's the thing: my friend is catnip to guys. She's short, petite, but pretty damn busty. It actually really sucks- she has trouble making platonic male friends and it frustrates her because they all want to get into her pants and she just wants to hang out. Here's the *other* thing- the store owner (we'll call him Boss, he's probably mid-40's, M of course) works day shift in the store *along with his wife* because we had such a hard time staffing the place.

A couple weeks in, he texts her. Our numbers are on a list in the back in case of need for a call-in, so it's no big deal, and he's just thanking her for coming in. He's a little awkward, but we dismiss it as him being an older guy, sort of out of touch, but he's a chill boss and treats us well enough so at this point we like him and have no problem giving benefit of the doubt. Another day we send him a silly picture of us together at the mall, from my phone this time. We notice he's a lot less talkative when its from me. And soon we talk to another employee who says Boss doesn't ever randomly text people unless its about work, so now we're getting wary.

This is where it gets real weird. She comes in to cover a weekend shift. He texts her thanking her, and calls her an ""amazing lady"" with a wink emoji, and then asks what her plans are Sunday!! She tries to make up an excuse but he says ""Let's have a coffee? This stays between me and you please""

She managed to kind of dodge around it. My friend hates conflict so she just kind of avoided answering until he took the hint. She left for school soon after, and I quit a couple months later. It's been about 2 weeks since my last day. We had talked about telling his wife- we work with her every day and she's really cool, strict but respects you as long as you work. But we didn't want to be in the middle of the drama, so we decided to wait until after I left. Now I'm long gone, but now that I don't have to see Boss every day it kind of feels like I should keep mum. After all, it was just coffee- it's still obviously hitting on her, but it'd be easy for him to spin into something innocent and it feels like none of my business now. We also thought about corporate, but I'm worried that's making a mountain out a molehill and it'll just start shit for the people who still have to work under him.

WIBTA if I told the wife?

Edit: she is aware of potentially telling the wife and fully supports me if I were to do it. She doesn't want to do it herself as I have mentioned, she's very conflict averse. Also, a couple people have said its a shitpost because we sent him 'silly pictures'- we only sent one, of just the top half of our heads bumped together. IMO doesn't warrant him asking her out.","NTA. Considering:

&gt; ""Let's have a coffee? This stays between me and you please"" 

He stated he wanted it to be kept a secret. Which implies that it appears to be more then just coffee.

954tfg,"That kinda sums it up, but here's a bit more info. He's 35 and great all around, thing is tho he's a heavy heavy drinker and it does have an impact on me, and will continue to worsen if he doesn't wake up. 

He's the main bread-winner and I won't pretend he's never stressed, but I think fairly everyone reasonably stressed for their own reasons, right? A drinking problem is a problem because it's viewed as a solution, from what I understand... I do believe he's bordering alcoholism. I'm talking drunk multiple times a week, frequently have to drag him off the couch and argue to get him to co-operate and go to bed. Slurred speech, talking non-sense, can't follow a conversation, doesn't remember things the next day etc... 

We've had many talks about his drinking. This is what I think is reasonable: keep the drunk nights to weekends, for weekdays I think 2-3 beers is reasonable, 4 on tough nights (whatever I can understand, I'm being reasonable won't start picking at things). My point isn't control, it's just that he's not constantly out of it and needing me to watch over him. 

Anyways, I usually get through to him with these conversations, but it seems to cycle in a sense that he'll see my points and agree, and absolutely does make an effort to cut down which I appreciate and praise. We live together, and are talking about a ring. I think this needs to be sorted and in order before actually getting married. But then a few weeks pass and it'll cycle again. So, as a solution to this, I made an Excel chart kind of like a calendar, marking the amount of drinks he's had that day and it's color coded green yellow and red (red is 5+ drinks that night). He doesn't know about this. I don't plan on ambushing him either. My goal is to keep track for both of our sake, and then we actually have real data to base future discussions on. The proof is in the numbers, and I am totally honest when writing the score down (if not sometimes more lenient towards his benefit, for example I don't keep track of drinks if we go out, and if he drinks half a can before passing out I don't count it etc.) Again, it's not about control, it's literally to see things as objectively as possible to then find the best solution as a team. 

I don't want to show him until it is needed, because for one right now he's at a good point and doing great so I don't want to bring him down out of nowhere for nothing, and for two he probably would manipulate it a bit like hiding empty cans so I don't have proper count, not out of maliciousness but out of shame. He's done this before, I can sympathize but it definitely is annoying and counterproductive. Question is, AITA for keeping track in secret like this?","&gt; Anyways, I usually get through to him with these conversations, but it seems to cycle in a sense that he'll see my points and agree, and absolutely does make an effort to cut down which I appreciate and praise.

**Do not marry an alcoholic. Do not do it. Think you two will be different? Think again. Think you're just special and he'll figure it out for you? Think again.

cbyiug,"This is probably a very minor thing compared to the other posts here, but I'm still pissed. I have this old calendar from 2017 in my office, I kept it up cause it has cute pictures of cats and dogs and my wall is really plain without anything on it.  I had it on a page with 2 black cats and a gold tabby cause they remind me of my 2 black cats and gold tabby at home.

My boyfriend and I work at the same company and eat lunch together. Today for some reason he thought it would be hilarious to colour in the cats' eyes black with a sharpie. I didn't notice right away until he pointed it out by saying ""the cats look much better with blackened eyes don't you think?"" I turn around to see the cats eyes are coloured in. I asked him if he did it with a sharpie and he said yes all while laughing. I get up to rip the calendar off the wall and toss it into my bin. I look back at him and say ""you could have fkn asked me first!"". He stops laughing and in an annoyed tone says ""what? you're not mad are you?"" I tell him that yes I'm mad, I had that calendar cause I liked the pictures.  He gets defensive and says ""it's old it's from 2017. you're mad over an old calendar?""  I tell him to not try to justify it. ""He gets up and talking down to me says ""its an old calendar, you're pissed at me over an old calendar. Think about it!"" before storming out of my office. Am I an asshole for being mad at him over something like this?

Update: I showed my bf your replies and he replies to me ""it was a fucking joke fuck"" I tell him there was nothing funny about defacing my things, he stormed off again and said ""I'm not doing what you asked me to do tonight"" (I guess as punishment for being upset?).

blz04z,"I'm using a throwaway because I don't want to embarrass myself or anyone else. 

For some background I have gone to one of three schools in my city that has a special education department. There are different levels of functioning and some of the kids are completely separate from us and some of the kids do kind of a mix of regular and special needs classes. I have known of this girl named ""Alicia"" since we were in middle school, sort of everyone does because she is in the special education department but she is very, very cute (to me she looks a lot like Ariel Winter). I finally have a history class with her and she was assigned to be my study partner along with another kid (who moved). The thing is, I really, really like her. I don't know what her issues are (she can be very slow to answer questions and she can absent for weeks at a time--I think this leads people to believe she's not smart, but she's very knowledgeable about certain things).  

I asked her to prom and she said yes. So like I've gotten three reactions, people who think I'm just doing a nice thing. The people I think are assholes who think I just did it to score ""SJW"" and ""woke"" points and the people who are being REALLY shitty and say that I'm just taking her because she is slow and i'm going to take advantage of her. 

I can deal with idiots at school by tonight my mom and dad sat me down and literally grilled me on my motivations. Like I mean grilled. My parents are super progressive people so this like really hurt. They basically demanded I rescind the offer, which to me would be even more of an asshole thing to do. My dad is demanding on calling Alicia's parents and telling her I can't go if I don't do it. My dad actually accused me of the r-word and I haven't even done anything yet! 

I'm so furious with them I want to literally run away but I can't. But while I'm locked in my room can I get some thoughts if I maybe appear as the asshole here?

I ran out of room because of 3000 characters but I can add more if info is needed.","NTA

You would be an asshole if you didn’t like her. Why? Because you would be leading her on. But you do, so it’s pretty much like asking out someone you like to prom.

Your intentions are good and nobody has a right to control or manipulate you in any way. It's your life and that means you control your own choices.

d12ftx,"Hey there, my sister has been with her current boyfriend for about a year. She recently texted me, telling me that she cheated on him with her ex boyfriend, and her current boyfriend ended the relationship.

Little backstory on her ex, he's a huge piece of trash. They dated for a year prior and he was a horrible human being to her. He controlled who she saw, talked to, what she did, she basically was only allowed to go work, and straight home. If he wasn't dictating what she could do, he was going through her phone, trash talking our family and insisted if she ever saw us again, he would leave her. They broke up a few times, off and on until I had to help her move out of her house with a police escort so he wouldn't go crazy. She moved in with me for a short time. 

She left the relationship and found her current boyfriend, he's transitioning from female to male. A lovely guy, funny, smart, and an overall great match for my sister. So it came out that she cheated, he's VERY upset, and I can't say I blame him. He loved my sister with everything he had and I can't imagine the pain he's going through. 

I cannot put myself through the stress of dealing with her being involved with this guy again, last time nearly broke my family because her decision to be with him and stay with him. I cannot watch her throw out a perfectly good, healthy relationship, for a dumpster fire. My family and myself cannot be put through this stress again. I don't know what to do.","I'm going to say NAH. I've never been in the situation, but research shows that it's not uncommon for victims of abuse to return to their abuser in one form or another. Often, it takes a hard path and multiple attempts to finally cut off the abuser for good.

I understand your concerns, and I would be extremely frustrated in your shoes. However, I really dont think it would do any good to cut your sister out of your life. If anything, it might push her further to her abuser if she feels like she's losing people. 

Try your best to be empathetic, help her, set some firm boundaries, but ultimately her decisions are her decisions and the way she feels is the way she feels. I would try to remove your feelings from the situation and focus on helping her.","

ar0bsw,"I'm M22, She's f20. Been together for about 6 months and she likes getting gifts so I knew she'd want something for V day plus dinner. I got her a charm from pandora for her bracelet and a ring from pandora, few roses, card, small teddy bear and a card and paid for dinner last night at a decent restaurant. She really liked all of this and I think I went over board but I really like her so I wanted it to be special for her. When we got back to my place I was kinda expecting her to give me a card or something at the very least seeing I just spent around $400 on her. But she just gave me head and we banged and that was it. 

This morning I mentioned that it would have been nice if she got me something and she got defensive saying that girls don't usually get guys anything (she said that because this is my first relationship) and that she's a student and doesn't have that much money and I work full time making good money. I kinda got sad but said ahhh ok and left it at there but I've been being dry to her today and she's been calling me an asshole and pussy for wanting something for V Day.

Because of so, he could’ve thought you were trying to get on first to grab the last seat or something.

brxqnx,"We have three little ones (1, 3, 7) and I feel so overwhelmed I can puke. 

The oldest is in school, which is great, but when he gets home all hell gets loose. My younger daughters are great but they need so much attention all the time (3 year old has health issues) and I am spread so thin at all times. 

I’ve asked my husband if we could send the younger two to full-day or half-day daycare and he refuses, saying that this is what I signed up for when I wanted more kids and wanted to stay home full time. He says we’d go bankrupt if I always got what I wanted. I get his point but I honestly feel like I’m gonna lose my mind if this goes on. 

We can’t really afford daycare for both of them without me going back to work, which is near impossible right now because we moved out to the middle of nowhere just so our kids could have a big house and I could stay with them. I can’t drive either so we’re really stuck. I know there’s a lot of issues here but I really can’t think of any alternative. We have no good friends or family near us. AITA for wanting to send my kids to daycare even though I wanted to stay at home with them at first?","YTA, and that's mostly because by your own admission, *you cannot afford to do this*. You wouldn't be an asshole so much as just irresponsible. Look, I'm not saying taking care of three kids is a cakewalk or anything, I get it, but you shouldn't be spending money you can't afford to spend. It's just that simple. Either find a place for it in your budget, or it's not an option. In the end, it is a luxury what you are asking for.

Consider a middle ground where you maybe hire a sitter for a part of the day once or twice a week. But only *if you can afford it*.","Getting over your driving fear would help, you clearly can’t afford child care but being able to drive allows you to take the kids places so they can also get out of the house, if you’re really against driving have you tried the bus or some other public transportation. Being in the house all day isn’t healthy for any of you.",0,3
cre6g5,"I'm a master's student at my university. I'm a computer science major but what my thesis deals with is music.

I use an electric nylon string guitar and there is basically nowhere to study or practice. I'm not particularly loud, it has no sound hole so the sound doesn't travel, but I do play in the computer labs on campus. I need to interface with the school computers directly, I can do little at home on my own.

There are no rules regarding noise. In fact, another of the MSc students plays a recorder. Not for any work, for fun. There's been complaints about me, though.

Last week I was doing my thing in the labs and there was a student with child. A baby, maybe no older than 6mo old in a car seat. I can't just stop what I'm doing, I work on deadlines, so I need to play. She got quite upset at me which I think prompted the formal complaint. I'm not going to say it's wrong for a baby to be here as every student's situation is different, but I'm here to do work for the university. Scholarly work. I like to think academics take priority in these computer labs.

There's been two other situations where formal complaints have been made, but my MSc supervisor brushed them off for the same reason I would: academics take priority.

98d232,"I broke up with my girlfriend of four years around 5 months ago for being too fat. (have only recently discovered r/AITA) 

She was always slightly above average weight-wise, never bothered me, been with bigger girls before. She had a the most beautiful smile I’ve ever seen. Incredible charisma, thoughtful, generous, hilarious, wicked smart and all the things I wanted in a life partner. 

We were great together, she was my first love and I honestly thought we'd always be together, we had planned out our lives together. Laughing at the drama of other couples. It was paradise, I was SO fucking happy. Happier than I ever thought deserved to be.

But in the latter 2 years her weight really ballooned, going up to a size 20/22. Christ knows I wasn’t brave enough to ask her exactly how heavy she was. She developed health problems because of it and her positivity and the smile I fell in love with disappeared. 

Those health problems and constant negativity/attitude stemming from her weight began to affect our relationship. It affected all the other things that attracted me to her in the first place. Her confidence, her positivity, her motivation. It wasn’t just the weight, it was everything that came from it.

Her best friend was personal trainer who gave her free PT sessions, free meals plans, everything so she had all the tools at her disposal and was better placed than anyone I knew to lose weight and keep it off. 

It came down to this; She wouldn’t look after herself. She wasn't willing to do anything about it and that was the biggest burden. I felt like I was walking on eggshells. I tried talking to her, but it was always construed that I was being unreasonable or deliberately trying to hurt or upset her and make her feel bad. 

Every time I broached the subject I was met with denial and anger. I would always apologise because I felt awful for making her feel bad.

Tried motivating her, I got a gym membership, went with her and followed her many diet plans. It very quickly became that I was going by myself and coming home to her on the sofa eating something unhealthy. 

I was going to gym so much because I didn’t want to be at home sitting next to this miserable person who I was expected never to criticise and be ok with it. I was physical repulsed to touch her. We had sex maybe twice in that final year. 

Her parents tried too, cooking very healthy meals when we would visit them, cutting all sugary treats out of the house, even when she wasn't there. But everyday she'd want a take-away or something unhealthy and guilt trip me into getting it. 

When I said, “You get what you want, I’m having a salad”, I was the bad guy because I wasn't being ""fat"" with her.

Tomorrow never came, ever. She would always be saying “As of Monday I’m really going to try, but for the weekend let me enjoy myself.” That became every weekend and when Monday came it was “I’ve had an awful day at work, I want to curl up with pizza and TV.” Got to the stage where she would say “I know I say this all the time, but THIS time, it’ll be different. THIS time I’m going to try”, but she wouldn’t. Skipping the gym because she felt “sick” or “wasn’t in the mood” or “I’ll double up tomorrow.” 

I stopped believing her, but still if I saw her making ANY effort, I praised and supported her. It was always short-lived. 

Here’s the caveat, in an attempt to make her take the issue seriously after months and months of trying to talk to her and getting rebuked and maybe get her to appreciate how I felt I told her it had crossed my mind to break up with her, that I really wasn’t happy, but that I was willing to work on our relationship and do what I could to make it better. 

In hindsight, not my best move but honest to god I didn’t know how to get through to her.

It all unravelled after we came home from visiting my parents a couple of weeks later, she was moaning about wanting something to eat for the plane and asked me to get her something from the vending machine, I refused. 
She’s got her own money and the machine was about 10 steps away, considering we’d had a large breakfast about an hour ago. (we’re about to starting boarding and its a 20 min plane trip) 

She goes off, really overreacted and when her parents picked us up at the other end started chewing me out in front of them. It was at this point I realised I just didn’t care anymore. I didn’t care what her parents thought of me or how upset I’d made her.

After everything I did to help I wasn’t even allowed to say no to her when she wanted me to get her food. They say the opposite of love isn’t hate its indifference and that was what I felt at that moment. 

We get home and long story short, words were exchange and she smacked me upside the head. Didn’t hurt but hard enough to knock my glasses off. That was the final straw. 

We broke up that night and I moved out that week, got my own place and a new job so I’m doing great. 

Looking back all I can say is she wasn’t fulfilling a need for me and I obviously wasn’t fulfilling a need for her either. Any Qs fire away. 

Edit: Formatting like an adult

Update: Thanks for the feedback everyone, appreciate your honesty. Going to reach out to her, see how she’s doing. Some of you have said she was suffering from depression and subsequent weight gain was the symptom of it. While I agree I also think it was the thing holding her back and had she lost the weight she would have felt better, one affected the other kinda thing. Obviously I’m inherently biased toward myself, think I lost my critical eye as I wrote it. I wasn’t an easy guy to live with and certainly had my own issues/stuff going on. 
Main reason I posted is because none of our mutual friends reached out to me afterwards so that was a big red flag that I was in the wrong but you guys have helped me get some closure so thank you x","Not the asshole. It sounds like you didn’t even break up with her because she got fat, but because she turned into a miserable, demanding person. ",When someone is gaining weight it's usually because they're not happy.  Not the asshole but adult conversations should have been happening.,0,1
e1vz1o,"My mother has always been a very protective person and has to be in control of everything. When I moved out six years ago she tried to manipulate me into doing her will nearly every time.

When my GF moved in with me she flipped. Calling my GF a golddigger, lazy, fat and told me what a disappointment I am for having a bachelor degree and not wanting to make a master. She even guild tripped me because I could not make it to a memorial for my grandma. I could not make it that day, because of some appointments and an hour ride I would have to make. Keep in mind, that she only tells me those things when we are alone, with company she tries to be the nicest person ever.

Now that my GF and I want to get married, she does not leave one chance unused to push my gf deeper in the dirt or to blackmail me. Those attempts are pretty various, telling my fiancee all the horrible things I did wrong when I was a child, take away my savings or to not give us one penny for the wedding (which no one asked for).

After one last chance to talk to her, she called my fiancee a golddigger, lazy and so on again. So I took a week to think about many things and I finally wrote her that she is not invited to the wedding. 

Suddenly my father and brother, who both knew about this situation and did nothing, come at me trying to put me back on line with ""if she does not come, we will neither"".

euk632,"long backstory here. 

My bf and I have been together for over 2 years, and we're talking about marriage, have been for a while. But it's still in the not so close future.

I had been friends with a girl (let's call her Kate) while I was in my senior year who eventually became friends with my boyfriend too. I trusted her, and I trusted him, and he'd give her rides home after school. I didnt question it. Maybe 6 months after this started happening, I found out through one of my other friends that Kate had supposedly had sex with my boyfriend. I obviously was pissed, confronted my bf, and eventually it all died down. I trusted him, and I really didnt believe her- she was what seemed like a pathological liar. 

 A few months ago, I found out that my boyfriend got a message from Kate, in the middle of the day, asking if he wanted to hook up. I went crazy. I couldn't believe after she had ""felt so bad she went home and puked"" after what she ""did"" over 1 year ago she would be so... something. But I never confronted her because I'm not dealing with high school bs anymore. My boyfriend supposedly told her off, asked her why she sent that message and blocked her.

I just saw that my boyfriend is still talking to Kate, because his phone turned on with a snapchat notification with her name on it. I'm shaking. He's in bed asleep next to me and I'm ready to scream. I'm not going to say it here, but she wanted him to do some weird shit with her. I'm ready to cry and scream...

The issue here is that I love him. I couldn't see my future with anyone else. We care about each other. He has a very good career, and the last thing I want to do is screw it up by confronting him on a monday morning, first thing. He tends to let even small things affect him at work... so I couldn't imagine this.

Part of this is my fault because I looked at his phone, but he does it to me once in a while and I dont make a fuss, I'm not scared and I dont have anything to hide. He takes his phone with him everywhere, face down. So... is it really my fault for being suspicious?? I dont know how to confront him without digging myself into a hole.

tl;dr : briefly looked at my bfs phone (like he does to me) and found out he's talking to a girl that he had told me he blocked, due to her asking him to hook up while with me, messing up the relationship with her whorish manner and the (false) rumors about them having sex while he was with me. 


AITA for checking his snapchat? And will I be the asshole for confronting him or even messaging her (or is it my place)?","You know he's cheating on you...right? Like it's so painfully obvious, and I think you do know it too. I am sorry. If I'm understanding your post correctly, you're what, 18 or 19 now? That's pretty young to be talking marriage. Especially with someone who is almost certainly cheating. Why do you think he carries his phone with him everywhere with the screen hidden? Because he has nothing to hide? Also that whole ""he tends to let even small things affect him at work"" thing sounds like a *whole* lot of bullshit. One - that is his problem, not yours. Two - it sounds to me like he's the kind of guy who makes you feel like you can't express your emotions lest they inconvenience him, leaving you tiptoeing around on egg shells. Which is controlling behavior, by the way. I know it feels like you can't imagine spending your life with anyone else...but I don't think this is the guy for you.","NTA, Why would she not be blocked as well as constantly ask to hook up if he has been rejecting her for 2 years?

bfon1q," A bit of backstory: I was diagnosed with autism at age 11, and my parents still expect me to be normal, and follow all of the unwritten rules of our society, which has lead to a lot of horrible scenarios which brings us today, where I don't want anything to do with my family due to the lack of emotional support and understanding (not to mention how infantile they act when things don't go their way).

So my parents recently got back from a trip to Europe, and upon their return they guilted me for not seeming very happy to see them return (i really wasn't). I told them that I am in fact happy to see them, I just don't show it very well. I lied obviously as I can't stand them, and they totally bought it. 

I'd like to mention that although they have the worst personalites and parenting techniques, my parents provide me with a weekly allowance, etc.

But you mentioned that you live with them, and they pay you to do so. If you don't appreciate that now, life only gets harder the older you get.

bes9bs,"My best friend, let's call her Tara, has been dating a guy who we'll call Miles for 2-3 years. Miles is a terrible boyfriend, to put it mildly. Not only is he emotionally abusive, but he can also be pretty aggressive and often calls her names during arguments. He also cheated on all of his ex girlfriends, and possibly her as well, and constantly disrespects her family. Tara is a real sweetheart who wouldn't hurt a fly, and he doesn't deserve her at all.

Tara's been telling me these things ever since they've been happening, and I've always made it clear how unsupportive I am of her relationship. Each time she comes to me in tears and, frankly, I'm so sick of it. They keep breaking up every few months, and she swears on her life she'll never get back together with him, yet as soon as he whistles, she runs back like a faithful dog.

Miles ghosted her in November for no reason whatsoever. After 2-3 years of relationship, he just ghosted, and found a new girlfriend 2 days later (I suspect he was already cheating). Tara was devastated, but honestly, I was so used to it, and knew they'd get back together eventually. He texted her a few days ago saying how he wanted to marry her, and she flew back to him.

Now he dumped her again, literally two days later. She's been crying on my shoulder again, but I'm so bored of her relationship drama at this point that I just told her ""Why the fuck are you even crying? We both know that as soon as he gets horny again, you'll run back to him, because that's what you are to him - a rag that he keeps reusing over and over again, and dumps it once he gets sick of it. You're being so stupid. He doesn't love you, and he never will.""

She didn't deny it. She just stood there silently, but I could see that it hurt her. I honestly couldn't keep it in any longer, but I was wondering, was I too harsh? Was I an asshole?

I understand that it’s difficult supporting a friend who’s in an abusive relationship, especially if the relationship has been going on for years. I’ve been in that situation multiple times. However, you’re doing the exact wrong thing. Look up how to support a friend in an abusive relationship and see if you can learn something. It’s hard but you have to suck it up and let them live their own life and wait for them leave their abusive partner on their own. It fucking sucks but that’s how it goes.

drhkym,"So this happened a couple weeks ago, and I'm still bitter about it. Some background, I'm a high school sophomore, and this was in my elective ceramics class. It was also National Unity Day. Due to cause and effect I'm kind of suspended now for it, although the suspension is not entirely related to my not wanting to work with them. 

So in my ceramics class, it's a community studio. Everyone helps out with cleaning up and keeping things maintained. That day it was my turn to reconstitute the old clay (taking the harder clay, ripping it up into small pieces, and filling the bag with water the make the clay softer again) and she wanted me to work with the special ed kids. (I'm not really sure what to call them, because I got yelled at for using the term ""special ed,"" but it's the only one I know, forgive my incompetence.) I don't have anything against them, they're actually pretty nice, but they (edit: the ones in my class) don't know person space. I've caught them touching my stuff without permission, picking them up, they've even touched the things I'm wearing (I painted a duck on my hat, and they were touching it without asking while it was on my head). I also have issues with people getting into my space from childhood trauma and the fact that I was in a homeless shelter until recently and a lot of my stuff was stolen in there. The space my teacher (T) wanted me to work with was also a small, secluded section of the classroom with not much room to walk around in. (Edit: this space is hard for me to walk around in with one other person, let alone four others.) 

So I quietly drew T aside and told her I was too uncomfortable to work with them due to my personal space issues. She took offense. She told me she was disappointed in me, and that if I say anything more I'll be on her ""radar.""

Now I actually liked T, and I didn't want her to think badly of me, so I emailed her later that night trying to explain the situation. But now I regret emailing her, because she read my words wrong and got the principal involved. Another situation caused by this has made me lose my respect for her, as I think this problem made her lose her logical reasoning towards me. 

AITA for refusing to work with them due to my personal space issues?

Edit: my counselor and school-appointed therapist do know. as does my mom. but as far as I can tell, my counselor agrees with my teacher and the others can't do much in this situation. After all, the punishment's already been dished out, it's not like they can turn back time.

Edit 2: Thank you all so much for supporting me!

I’ve tried to explain that I’m doing this based on others but no one will listen. I know this is wrong, I know I shouldn’t tell her what to do. There are some things that I suggest that no one else suggested and she does that no problem, and people get even angrier at that. Like I just recommend advice on setup for a crib, essentials for a baby, and how to baby proof her house and people say I’m doing it wrong. 

I know this is a sensitive topic and it could go wrong if I give wrong advice, so I try to research before, but I know if I didn’t suggest things then my sister just wouldn’t do anything that the doctor recommends. That’s the kind of person she is.

e7fs18,"A little bit of background: my (F, 30s) parents divorced when I was 20, after living in a really bad marriage for many years. I don't think it was always as bad as it was at the end, but I don't remember a time when I think they were really happy. There's a lot of bad feeling between them now. My mother has an anxiety disorder that can make interactions with her difficult. My father has a blunt and abrasive nature that can offend people. They were really ill-suited as partners, but they're good and loving parents.

I love them both, but as an adult I'm much closer to my father. It's just how our relationships developed.

For a few reasons, my father has begun making plans for his funeral. When he was buying his burial rights at a cemetery, they asked him if he wanted to reserve the plot next to him for anyone, and he ended up buying it for me.

I told him I may end up not using it (I currently live overseas and who knows where/when I'll die?). He was fine with that and joked about how if it's empty he'll be able to stretch out. Then again, maybe I will use it; you have to go somewhere, after all. At any rate, it seems to give him some comfort to think of it and it doesn't bother me at all.

But when I told my mother about it, she was furious. She doesn't want me buried near her or anything; she's planning to be cremated and have her ashes scattered. But she sees this as me choosing my father over her in a very definitive way. She also thinks it's insulting to my brother that he's left out of the plan (my brother and my father rarely speak, plus my brother is married and will probably want to make his own plans with his wife). She wants me to sell the burial rights back to the cemetery.

The thing is, I really don't want to hurt either of my parents. My father is pretty much alone in the world (my mother has remarried) and he's dealing with some health issues. If it makes him feel better knowing I have this burial plot, then I want to keep it. But I know my mother wishes she and I were closer and I don't want to hurt her either.

dlge2p," So, im still slightly in contact with my exes friend, lets call him Lucas. Me and lucas are still friends in a videogame thingo and rarely talk.

One day Lucas came to talk to me, we talked and i asked how my ex was. He told me that my ex was in a new relationship. 
He told me he didnt understand why my ex always had girlfriends but he have never even been on a date with a girl before.
He was kinda sad about it and jealous to my ex.

I wanted to make him feel better by telling that my ex was manipulative piece of shit and thats the reason he always gets women but the relationships never last. I wanted to tell him every little and big thing my ex did to me and what kind of person he really is. 

All i ended up saying was ""My ex was manipulative, i will tell u everything about it some other time"".  

But now im not so sure if i should tell him, its non of his business but i know Lucas has always been jealous of my ex, and i wanna make him feel better because he is actually a nice person and he shouldnt be jealous of him.

cowczz,"My neighbours are often super loud, blasting music at 2am, yelling, blaring the TV. I’ve gone round various times politely asking if they could be quieter.

It’s actually turning me off sex. I find them insufferable. 

 As petty revenge, I’m considering recording them having sex and playing it back to them through the walls whenever they’re loud, instead of going round to politely request they stfu at 3am.

ceo6wy,"My girlfriend is a veterinarian assistant, studying to be a vet. As a result, she loves animals. We have three cats and two dogs, that I joke she probably loves more than me. I also love these animals, keep that in mind, and I agreed to three of the five. The first cat we got was unexpected when I was out of town, abandoned at the clinic she works at, filthy and in need of a home. She fell in love and couldn’t let her go. I couldn’t blame her there. I wouldn’t be able to turn the kitty away in that situation. One of the other cats…she just kind of accepted from a co-worker without talking with me. It wasn’t an emergency situation or anything. The co-worker was moving out of the country and my girlfriend was the first person she asked.

All of that being said, I’m pretty much done animal wise. My girlfriend occasionally tags me in those “Haha, one day you’ll come home and there’ll be 10000 dogs” posts on Facebook, and sometimes I worry she’s not joking. Then a few months ago, she started talking about another cat, because they got another abandoned one who is pregnant. They found a home for the mama once she gives birth and is through nursing…but the kittens need homes. I told her no and said that she was great at finding homes for animals (true), she’ll find one.

Tonight…she brings home a kitten. I was pissed. I told her that we can’t do this, we have 5 animals and even though we could afford a 6th, taking care of another will be exhausting. She tried guilting me with this kitten and I told her that we could keep him until he found a home, but then he was leaving. She thought I was kidding, but I put a post on Facebook saying “Hey, looking for a safe home for a kitten. Looking for applications.”

ei4gyq,"Throwaway. 

I had a rough childhood. My parents were fine but I never had much friends and since I was in about 7th/8th grade, I just remember kind of always being unhappy. In my early years of high school I was always sad &amp; would cry myself to sleep some nights. As I got older &amp; got more freedoms, part-time jobs, money of my own etc, I got better but I was never truly a happy person. I had anxiety &amp; at times depression. 

I’m 20 now &amp; have been vegan for 1 year. I went vegan for several reasons, mostly ethical, environmental &amp; if I’m being perfectly honest - I never cared much for meat anyways &amp; I’m allergic to dairy so it wasn’t a tough time for me transitioning. My parents seemed reasonably supportive. 

I finally decided to pour out my feelings of sadness to my mother in the hopes she might help me seek therapy for my problems. She proceeded to tell me she thought as a vegan I was missing essential nutrients in my diet &amp; that’s why I was depressed. I asked her if she listened to a thing I said about being depressed since I was 13/14. She insisted I need to go to the doctor for a blood test. I dropped the subject &amp; said I was just feeling shitty about my exams at university &amp; I’d be fine after a good nights sleep. She said that sounds reasonable. This was 2 months ago. 

Last week I tried to broach the subject with her again &amp; once again she said veganism was the reason. I was missing essential nutrients in my diet from not eating meat. This time I got really angry with her. I asked her why she couldn’t listen to what I was saying. For how long I’ve just been constantly sad. Why she thinks get aism is causing my problems when, if anything, it has helped me feel better about myself as I learned to cook. I then told her if this is the only response she’ll I’ve me then I might as well pretend I’m happy &amp; never tell her about my problems. 

I ended up once again pretending everything was fine &amp; my mom went off to finish off Christmas things. This was a week ago &amp; I guess I’m just never going to be able to talk to my mom about what’s really wrong. Even if I went to the doctor to see what’s going on, it wouldn’t matter if he told me I was healthy or not, I’m still angry with my mom for not listening to me. Even if I was missing essential nutrients in my diet which I highly doubt because I eat fairly well, it doesn’t explain why I’ve felt so shitty about myself from ages 13-18. 

AITA for not trusting my mom with my feelings anymore? She’s actually usually such a great mom &amp; person, it makes me angrier &amp; sadder this is the way she reacted.","NTA - I'm sorry you've been so consistently dismissed and questioned. That said, as a fellow depressed vegan, you might want to check your B12 levels because a deficiency will worsen your symptoms a lot.","NTA - You told her twice, yet she still wants to blame your diet.

euxmq6,"I (24F) live in an apartment with 3 other people. We have an onsite washer and dryer which is THE BEST, but I've had some disagreements with my one roommate, D, over washing clothes.

You see, D invites her friend M over to wash her clothes  one to two times a week. M overloads the washer and dryer EVERYTIME and I'm worried shes going to burn out the motor. I dont say anything though. M puts stuff in the washer and dryer, then D and M leave to go to the bars for a couple hours. 

I was out of work clothes yesterday, so I took the stuff out of the dryer and put it into her bag and put the wet stuff on top of an empty basket. I did my laundry and left to go to the gym with everything OUT of the machines.

apparently, M did not like this. She was very upset that I touched her things and didnt like that I ""thought I took priority over her."" and ""why couldn't I wait until she got back?"" 

I DO think I take priority over her because she doesn't live here OR pay the water bill. I dont think I should have to wait until 12pm to do my laundry so I can wear clean work clothes!

D sided with M and said it was creepy that I touched her stuff and mean that I didn't fold it.

dbytxn,"Okay so it's my second year at college and I met this guy, let's call him Tomand we've become best friends ever since, we've been through hardships together, help each other flirt with girls, got drunk and partied together, etc

He introduced me to his highschool squad and the guys are cool as shit, all of us (the squad, Tom and I) went to parties, got drunk and have had a lot of fun

Turns out Tom found himself a girlfriend, a girl from our very own classroom, naturally he has left his social life unattended, has stopped partying, stopped smoking weed, doesn't drink anymore and has not gone out with me (or the boys) not one single time since he has a gf, whatever it's his life but it kinda felt bad to loose a party buddy, still a great friend nonetheless 

I go out with his friends more than he does now and I've gotten a lot closer to them than him now, specially since he doesn't go out anymore

His gf and I have never gotten along, we don't hate each other or have harsh feelings for one another, nah it's passive indifference, she's doesn't care for me and viceversa, however Tom has told me ""she thinks you're kinda silly sometimes"" bc of my absurd sense of humor (but Tom and I share this same sense of humor) however he's Mr. Perfect now, so he acts mature all the time

His gf is having her birthday this next Saturday, and Tom is organizing a surp birthday party for her, he didn't directly tell me, I knew bc of the squad, but I haven't been told shit
So wanting to know I said to one of the boys of his squad to ask him about me, obviously without saying I asked, just asking if I was gonna go to the party and it went like this

-Hey Tom, Is [OP] going to your girl's party?

-no, he isn't 

-why not dude?

-well, my girl doesn't really like him, they don't hate each other but he kinda doesn't belong there, it's her party


BUT he invited the rest of the squad, he invited the rest of the boys, just like that, some of them she likes, some she doesn't even know, some she doesn't care about, etc

But he left me out of it

I wouldn't care if she organized the party and she didn't invite me, after all she isn't my friend as I stated before, but HE'S my friend, and HE'S the one organizing it

On one part I get it, it's her party, and no one is forced to invite me anywhere, I'm not entitled to an invitation there and no one owes me anything, but on the other part he's my closest friend, and he invited a bunch of other guys who some she cares, some she doesn't talk to too much, some she likes and he consciously decided to left me out, 

So I feel kinda mad and disappointed by this dude
WIBTA if I got mad with him about this?

TLDR: best friend organized surprise birthday party for his gf, invited bunch of people, but left me out because ""she doesn't really like me, doesn't have a problem but she's not my friend"", would I be the asshole to get mad over this?",YTA.

bn2jpd,"My wife and I have been together since high school(we're in our thirties now), and ever since I was young I have hated lipstick. My mother wore it, she had the kind that would come off on every glass and and I come from a family of bad dishwashers, so you had to check every glass in the house for it. I know, just like other types of make-up, there are shades of lipstick that I probably really like and just don't realize are lipstick(In fact I know there are, my wife wears those), but I'm refering to colors that stand out here, they just aren't my thing.

So either way, a few weeks ago she decided she wanted to wear dark red lipstick, it was gonna be her new thing. I of course, like a ""super supportive husband"" reminded her I hate lipstick, and don't love that idea, but maybe I'd grow used to it if she rocked it for a while. A week went by, and honestly, my wife went from a 10 in my eyes to someone I hated looking at. The face is where you look, and I hated looking at her because of an unexplained aversion to lipstick. I realize that makes me crazy, but I can't help what I'm attracted/not attracted to, can I?

I asked her to maybe stop wearing it around me, she agreed and would take it off after work when she got home, but then it became a ""I can't look at you till you take your make-up off"" when she gets home.(I get home a few hours earlier, because of our schedules, so I'm usually waiting for her). We did that for a week or so, then ended up having, honestly one of the larger disagreements we've had in a while over lipstick of all things...

I'm actually writing this post our resolution, because we both wanted to know the internet's thoughts, but our conversation basically boiled down to me saying that I knew it was crazy to feel so strongly about this subject, but I also felt like it's not something I kept hidden, we've had many discussions about it over 15 or so years. I told her that I felt pressured into a position of having to like something I hated or be painted as an unsupportive asshole.

As we talked we both realized that we've been together for a long time, and sometimes we're both too... comfortable walking over objections, because a lot of times that's how our relationship works. We're both naysayers, and it takes one of us to drag the other one into something. Just the other week I decided we needed to get into ""A certain series"" because of ""a certain movie"", even though we both had no real interest. We both ended up happier having seen them all, and my wife was just trying to do the same thing with the red lipstick. You don't grow without trying new things, but seriously I fucking hate lipstick.

TLDR: As my wife put it, ""are we really having an argument about fucking lipstick?""","YTA. I know it's irrational, and you know it's irrational. I really don't think your wife wanting to look pretty to more people than just you is something that should bug you on such a level. You guys seem to have good communication skills, which is great.

cu9fnz,"A while ago a coworker and I started talking and things started got personal and we had a moment of sharing about our parents getting sick and how her mom might pass and how my dad passed recently. At first I shared my number with her just to check up on each other and make sure we were both okay. We had a few conversations over text and in person at work where it was almost therapeutic just sharing with each other. This all started very innocently and it wasn't my intention to have it turn into anything else. But somewhere along the way I realized that we have things in common and that I might be developing feelings for her. 

She has shared with me before that she wasn't able to have these types of conversations with her boyfriend and that he wasn't good at being supportive. For example she wanted to dye her hair and where I said I think it'll look good, her boyfriend told her it's going to ""look stupid"". 

The other day she told me that her boyfriend went through our conversations and got upset that she was talking to me about things he felt like she should be talking to him about. I didn't really know what to say to that but the way she described it made me feel like it was kind of a breach of not just her privacy but also mine. She also told me she couldn't do it anymore and was done with it. Since we were at work that conversation didn't really go anywhere as we both got busy.


My friend thinks that I'm not an asshole and that I should still try to be there for her when she needs it and that I don't have any ulterior motives.

You're playing on the ""grass is always greener"" aspect of relationships. Real life boyfriend doesn't like blue hair, but the boy in the phone thinks it'll look nice. You're giving her an out for actually talking to her current boyfriend about disagreements, and that out is you. 

You've been in a relationship, right? Did the girl in that relationship ever do things you didn't like, and you expressed your dislike to her? What if, when you did that, she had a ""yes man"" in her phone to back up her side? Wouldn't that make you feel like you couldnt say anything negative to your girlfiend or be honest with her? It's manipulation.

You're clearly using this ""be there for her"" thing as an excuse, be honest. Stop throwing your two cents in on her relationship. Because right now you're telling her that if she breaks up with current bf and goes for you, then she has a free pass to find another yes man the first time you disgree. If you really want a relationship with this girl, let her ride it out on her own so you won't be guilty of a double standard when you object to her yes man in the phone.",1,1
bs9qii,"Using names from a show cause I'm bad at fake names. 

So my BIL Dan is a serial cheater. My fiancé and I are still friends with his most recent ex Chloe, Dan knows this. His gf of 2 months Charlotte texted me panicking because he didn't come home (he moved in with her right away) and his phone was off, so she asked me to try to find out where he was. I immediately figured that he was with his ex (whom he cheated on with Charlotte) because I know that he still talks to her. According to Chloe, he tells her all the time that he's not even in a relationship and hints that they could get back together. That night around 2am, my fiancé checks his phone to see a missed call from Chloe and a text saying something like ""hey bro it's Dan, I'm gonna come over"", so obviously we now know that Dan was with Chloe. He never came over. 

The next day, Chloe and Charlotte text me at about the same time. Chloe tells me that she was at the hospital with Dan, Charlotte says Dan came home and told her that he had been alone at the hospital. Chloe says that Dan told her he was coming to my apartment because ""he had nowhere else to go"" after supposedly breaking up with Charlotte.

At this point I called Chloe and got further details that made me even more pissed with Dan. Basically, he picked her up, got a motel room and they... did things... before he woke up feeling crappy and wanted to go to the hospital. So I then called my fiancé and told him I wanted to tell Charlotte the truth about how Dan was with Chloe. Charlotte is pregnant (I know, it seems really soon to me too but whatever) and I hate the thought that Dan could give something to the baby by being unfaithful. He said fuck it, because he's tired of being caught up in Dan's lies too. I didn't tell Charlotte that Dan literally cheated on her, just that he was with Chloe at the hospital. The reason I didn't tell her about the cheating was I had no proof, but I could at least prove that Dan was with Chloe. Supposedly he even put Chloe's address on his paperwork for the hospital. 

Predictably, Dan blocked me and Charlotte removed me on facebook after saying Dan told her not to talk to me anymore. I honestly don't care, I kind of figured he'd lie his way out of it. The reason I'm doubting myself now is that I told my fiance's other brother and sister (on his mom's side, they're not related to Dan) what happened and they both got on my case saying that I shouldn't have said anything. My logic is, if I were Charlotte then I would have wanted to know, so I told her. But they told me nope, that now they know they can't trust me with anything. I said yeah, don't tell me you're cheating because I will not keep that shit to myself. I hate cheaters. I would not have been able to look Charlotte in the eye and pretend everything was fine. 

So, AITA?

cu1tyy,"My boyfriend (m22) and I (f20) agreed to move into this apartment with my friend from high school (m21) and his girlfriend (f20), they had previously been living in the apartment with another couple who decided they were ready to move into their own place. Anyway the leasing office is making the whole situation a lot more difficult than it needs to be, so the four of us have decided that we would be better off getting a house instead since combined, we have three large dogs. 

I digress, after this agreement, it’s brought to our attention that my friend’s girlfriend is very pregnant (something that was heavily downplayed before the agreement) and I do not like babies. She will probably be close to 7 months along when we move in. They have no contingency plan for if we can’t find a new place before the 22nd of next month and are relying on my boyfriend and I to secure the deposit and first month’s rent. They’ll pitch in what they can now and will reimburse us for the rest of their half once we get settled because their money is tied up in their apartment right now. We will also be purchasing a w/d and a kitchen table set for the house. Due to this, my boyfriend and I will be taking the master bedroom. 

My friend and his girlfriend are hoping for at least a 3br so that they can have the extra room for the baby. Before this, we were planning on splitting rent and utilities evenly but now I feel that since they want to take two rooms, they should be paying at least a little bit more. I feel bad because the baby was unexpected and they don’t make much money currently, but my boyfriend and I are trying to save up for our wedding and have student loans to pay off among other things.

ctov90,"There's a convenience store/pizza resteraunt by my house that I've gone to for years. They make fantastic pizza, and I'm friendly with the owner and a few of the cooks. Kitchen is open to view so you can see them making pies and the oven, etc.

a7p412,"I had to drive 1.5hrs to a specialist vet for my dog. I drained the battery in my electric car I found 3 charging locations near me, 1 at a mall, 1 at a AAA business center thing, and 3 was at a local cafe. 

The mall was all being used, AAA was broken and when I pulled up to the Cafe there was a gas Audi parked in the spot. I googled my states law and it states:

&gt; Florida Statute 366.94 Electric vehicle charging stations
(3)(a) It is unlawful for a person to stop, stand, or park a vehicle that is not capable of using an electrical recharging station within any parking space specifically designated for charging an electric vehicle.
(b) If a law enforcement officer finds a motor vehicle in violation of this subsection, the officer or specialist shall charge the operator or other person in charge of the vehicle in violation with a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as provided in s. 316.008(4) or s. 318.18.

I was stuck waiting here since I didn’t have enough to get me to the next one (which could be broken or in use) and it was the only one working since AAA was broken and not just busy. 

I called the non-emergency line to complain, I even asked two workers if they knew whose car it was, they didn’t know.  I waited in the closest spot hoping police or owner of said car would do something. 

Cop shows up comes over to me an says “There is no law for this so why did you call me?” I showed him the above quoted statue and he says “I have to look this up.”  He goes back to his squad car and the owner comes out yelling at me that it’s his car and he paid $1500 to install that and if he wants to park there he will and I need to get off his property or he will hit me with trespassing. Now I have to pay to park and charge in that spot, this was not a free charge while you eat/shop kind of thing. Cop comes out to say that I am right, it is illegal to block the spot and he also cannot ask me to leave because I am paying for the spot and I have a contract with ChargePoint the actual owner of the charger. 

So AITA for this? The owner did not get a ticket for parking in the spot because the cop felt it was “up to his discretion” to decide if he violated the statute. ","NTA.

b43rir,"ETA: TL;DR at the end bc I realised this got long and all over the place.

I (18M) have known I was gay since I was ~11 or 12 years old, and I kinda realised I'd never fancied a girl or woman in my life. I had the expected struggle with coming to grips with it but it honestly wasn't that difficult for me to come to terms with myself. 

However. For all of my life it's been just my mum and I at home, as I'm an only child and my dad passed away before I was born. Mum has never been overtly homophobic, per se. Like, she isn't the type of person to bang on about how gay is disgusting and homos are gonna burn in hell and it's all sick and perverse etc. But she *is* the type of person who makes comments about how she ""doesn't see the point"" of Pride and claims she doesn't get why marriage equality is ""such a big deal"". Also, when my cousin came out as lesbian and started bringing her girlfriend to family events, Mum semi-frequently complained about her ""shoving her sexuality down everyone's throats"" and how she ""doesn't mind, just doesn't see why [COUSIN] is so 'in your face' about it"". (To clarify, cousin is very much *not* into PDAs so it's not like she and her girlfriend are constantly making out in public or w/e, they just hang out, dance together, etc.) All this to say, I don't believe my mother actively hates gay people or wishes any kind of harm or ill will upon any of us, but she's made it clear in the past she doesn't particularly *like* gay people very much either. 

Because of this, I've kept my sexuality from her. I convinced myself that coming out while under her roof could get real awkward for me. I didn't think she'd be angry but I guessed she'd be uncomfortable, a la how she feels about my cousin, and I couldn't take that level of awkwardness in my own living situation. I'm going to uni in September and will be moving ~1.5hr drive from my hometown for it. My plan was to come out after I moved out so that, even if there was some discomfort there, at least I wouldn't be around it constantly. Suffice to say, this didn't happen. 

Basically, I lent her my laptop to send some emails for work while hers was broken and I guess I left my Facebook open and she saw some messages between me and this boy I've been sort of seeing. She confronted me about it and I told her because what's the sense in denying it? She *flipped* - not because I'm gay, but because I'd been lying to her all this time (I have explicitly told her I'm straight and brought girls home in the past). I tried to explain that I wasn't comfortable coming out yet, she took offence and kicked me out. I'm currently staying with my grandparents and I don't know if I'm ever gonna go back to my mum's. 

I feel kinda shitty. Not because I'm gay, obviously I know I'm NTA for that. But maybe mum's right, maybe lying to her was a sucky thing to do. Like I could've dodged questions about sexuality/not brought girls home - more so avoided the truth than outright lying. I love my mum and I don't want to lose her over this. AITA?

TL;DR: Mum has made it plainly apparent throughout my life that she's not exactly comfortable with gay people. I pretended to be straight and intended to come out after I moved out of her place to avoid discomfort/awkwardness for both of us. She found out, got upset that I'd lied to her and kicked me out. I feel shitty for making her feel lied to. ","NTA. No one in this entire world has the right to force you to come out. That decision is yours and yours alone. Being honest, kicking you out for keeping it secret sounds like an excuse for being homophobic. Good luck, OP. ","NTA

Look at her reaction. You were right.

You were right to keep this from her. She is not privileged to that information. It is your right to share that with the people you want. Yes, you lied to her, but she's also homophobic.

I don't think anyone, no one reasonable anyway, would tell you to put yourself in the line of fire. Especially with your home, shelter, security possibly depending on it. Controlling parents are frightening. It's a delicate dance of being close enough to them but also staying safe.

b4jqj3,"We had been together for almost a year. I dreaded when they would come over during his allotted custody time. One is 3 and would whine nonstop and cry about everything. It’s typical for that age but I genuinely could not stand it. 

  The other is 5 and has undiagnosed autism. It was too much for me to handle. I knew that I didn’t have the patience to deal with it long term, and his refusal to get him tested put a strain on our relationship as is. 

  I have two kids of my own and I love them to death, but I’ve never been a “kid person.” My kids are not the perfect package either, but he accepted them and treated them as if they were his own. He was amazing with them.

   I expressed how I felt about his kids several times during the course of our relationship, and that I didn’t think I would ever be able to love them. He is a great guy and is very kind and patient, but that baggage was too much. 

  I’ve never been mean to them, and treated them exactly like I treated my own kids, but putting up the facade of loving them when I didn’t was exhausting. 

I broke up with him recently and let him know it was because I didn’t think I’d be able to be the step-parent they deserve, and that I didn’t think I would ever change how I feel about them. I want him to be with someone that loves his kids and has the patience to endure all that comes with them.

I would have left him immediately if he said he didn’t like my kids, because I would want what’s best for my own kids and not just stick it out for selfish reasons. I have no idea how he justified staying with me after the multiple conversations.

  I feel incredibly guilty about it, and I’m wondering if I’m a complete asshole for leaving him because of his kids. Should I have stuck it out? Did I do what’s right by recognizing that I can’t be what the kids deserve?","NAH. You did the right thing. If you can't take care of his kids, it would be best to get out of that relationship.

e0ox3u,"So I (19F) am studying abroad and there’s a 6 hour time difference between me and my boyfriend (20M). 

I went out today with my friends to a really crowded but very fun market, and send the occasionally text to my boyfriend showing him some stuff, but ultimately it was so crowded I couldn’t really use my phone comfortably. The last pic I sent him was a picture of myself, he responded “cutie”. Anyways, we wrapped up what we were doing and went home. 

Leaving the market, I was super exhausted, so as soon as I got home I fell asleep. I woke up a few hours later to being spam called by my boyfriend, texting me saying I forgot him with an extremely passive aggressive tone. 

I sleepily told him I had fallen asleep and he passive aggressively just told me to go back to sleep. 

I tried to, but I couldn’t as I had been waken up from his spam calling, which seriously annoyed me. So I sent him a text saying I felt monitored or controlled if I can’t even do something like go home and fall asleep without constantly texting him. I didn’t say he was wrong for it- I get some people like the constant updates. But for me, it’s a hassle and obsessive to have to remember to text your partner whenever you’re doing something new or changing locations or going to bed early, and I was trying to communicate that. 

He immediately became defensive and started arguing with me, basically saying if “I can’t do the bare minimum he doesn’t want me”. (We’ve been in a rough patch the past 4 months over stuff like this). I tried to argue back and say this wasn’t right but he just sent me walls of texts ignoring what I was saying and I tried to call him so I could speak but he declined every call. 

Now he’s telling me I fucked up and this is my issue not his. I don’t think that’s true but I don’t know, maybe he’s rightfully upset I was gone for a few hours and I was too dismissive of that. 

AITA?","OkNTA, and you didnt ghost him.  You fell asleep theres a difference.","NTA. I understand to give your partner updates time to time so they don’t worry, but that’s just excessive.

e3qnlu,"Now, I know the title sound bad but here me out on this. I've been dating this girl for almost 3 years now. She has BPD and has many triggers and such. Sometimes she really stresses me out with her emotions and constant mood swings.

We have very different views on things that spark many arguments. Some of them have even made her cry. There's also been times where she gets sad for no reason or won't even tell me why she's upset in the first place. I've comforted her many times but lately I haven't been doing it as often. It stresses me out a lot and most the time it doesn't even make her feel any better.

The other night she had a panic attack and I was already pissed off and upset about something else. I told her I wasn't in the mood to deal with her right now and she got even more upset. After I told her off, she refused to talk to me for the rest of the night.

The morning afterwards, she confronted me about how she does so much for me but she feels like I don't do much in return. I couldn't help but agree with her on that. Come to think of it, even if she's upset, she still tries her best to make me feel better, even if it stresses her out. And if she tells me she can't handle it, I usually get mad at her.

But, my gf knows how stressed I've been lately and she has promised not to dump so much stress on me but she does it anyway. No matter how much I tell her off, she still does it.

I know this was a little short and probably vague but, am I the asshole here?

Edit: Alright guys. After reading all these comments, I've realized that yes, I'm completely in the wrong here. I had a long talk with her last night and I encouraged her to get therapy, which she's going to do. We both also agreed on going to counseling to keep our relationship stable. I will communicate with her in a much better way from now on and I will stop taking things out on her. I will improve myself to become a better boyfriend.","YTA

c4e84s,"I don't think it's really stalking or I wouldn't post here, but yeah. He came and spoke to me at a party with some others (probably because I was standing alone) and we talked for a bit and then he just left. His friends stayed but he went. He said he would be right back but he didn't come back. We didn't speak for long, but I felt a  connection to him. We had a lot in common and I wanted to speak to him more. 

So I searched up one of the friends names on Facebook (it had been said earlier), went through it, and found him in their friends list. His account was semi public, so you could see some photos and old posts, but not all for some reason. I scrolled for a bit and I learned some things about him without even meaning to. Then I requested some people on the previous friend's list and hoped they'd be friends with him too, and eventually a few accepted (I will admit I did join some's Facebook groups and talk to them in there so they would accept) and then we eventually had mutual friends! So then after a week of this I requested him. He accepted it. I messaged him asking if he was the guy at the party and said how much of a coincidence it is we already had mutual friends and he showed up as a suggestion for me to add (maybe this lie wasn't very good, no). He said yes and we started talking. I watched his favourite shows and listened to his music so we'd have something in common too (I DID legitimately enjoy them, I didn't lie) We then just started talking, he asked me on a date, and now we've been in a great relationship for 8 months.

I would bring this up to him IMMEDIATELY. You don’t want this weighing on you and for him to find out out somehow down the road.

He’s never taken me out on any dates because he just doesn’t have the money and lately he hasn’t been texting me like he normally would. He doesn’t say good morning or goodnight or I love you. I always start the conversation first. And when I bring it up, he makes me feel bad that I’m concerned about it. 

He told me today that his coworker met my father and told my father that he took one of his female friends out for coffee last Friday. He barely had any time for me that day. Wouldn’t even call me to say goodnight. 

I bring up that as soon as I asked him to meet my dad, as soon as I wanted a real relationship, he stoped coming over. He stoped being affectionate. He says that I’m paranoid and that I obviously don’t know him.

b72wip,"Throwaway, cause his sister uses reddit.

My boyfriend has very recently started to develop symptoms that we can only describe as depression. His mood is low, he doesn’t laugh at anything, he isn’t affectionate, he looks exhausted, and he just wants to sit and play on his PS4. I’m trying my best to be supportive, encouraging him to book an appointment with the doctor (I don’t have permission to for him), and he agrees but he never does.

He used to get severe headaches everyday so I was used to him lying down for 3-4 hours leaving me alone with our son, but now he never helps. If I ask for something, there’s only a 20% chance he will get up from his game and do it, and he is always mildly annoyed with me that he had to.

I am exhausted, and burnt out. He works 6-7 hours a day 5 days a week, and stays up until 3/4am playing games but I am constantly looking after our 9 month old. I snapped at him a couple of days ago after he complained I didn’t wash his shirt with “Can you give me a fucking minute?” and he has been cold since. I tried talking to him a couple times and apologizing for losing my patience but he won’t have it. He just replies with things like “Just tell me you don’t love me anymore” and “I learned my lesson, I’ll just shut the fuck up”.  

Today, he told me he was going to gamble half of his paycheque because he worked hard for it. I didn’t want to pick a fight but I told him I thought it was a bad idea. We had a huge argument after he told me to go live with my parents if I didn’t like the way he lived, and I listed everything I do around the house for our son since he is not contributing, and that I don’t expect a 500$ blowout reward for it.

amktac,"For years she has been unhappy and I have encouraged her many times to move to another position or company. She had never wanted to quit for a variety of reasons but now has had just about enough and is willing to move on. 

She has a masters degree and a long career that would give her the ability to find another decent job. She makes a decent amount of money now and I don’t see why she shouldn’t try to get more if not at least the same amount. 

If she does get another job at 50% her current salary she’ll essentially be earning just barely enough to cover childcare, healthcare, and perhaps a little towards retirement but nothing else. And I mean nothing else leftover. 

Is it fair to me and our children for her to insist on finding a job for so much less in pay? Am I an asshole for trying to convince her to set her goals a bit higher. I don’t want to now have to carry the burden of earning all the money for household expenses and disposable income. I also don’t want to have to follow a tight budget instead of having plenty of income with little to no cash worries. Right now we could live on either one of our incomes but if she takes a pay cut and I am downsized (which has happened) we would be in a bind. 

She’s stressed and perhaps thinks a position with less responsibility will be easier on her psyche (she had a mental breakdown). 

I have had some stressful jobs so I get it that’s she wants to move on. But I say to something better. When I bring it up she makes it out that I’m being and asshole for not agreeing with her. 

Edit: Thank you all for the feedback; even the YTA have been very insightful. Just to be clear I have been the one encouraging her to move on for years. She has been the one not wanting to move on. But moving on to a lesser paying position, in my opinion, won’t lower the stress but will, in many ways, make it worse. I understand mental breakdowns because I have had them and why I have been the one to encourage the move. The only disagreement is what type of position would make her and all of us happier considering every aspect of our lives. 

But again all the feedback has been appreciated and helpful and I have learned a lot. 

Edit 2: Also I have never told her she can’t do what she wants. I have only brought up the anticipated budgeting problems (once). I have suggested her taking some time first looking for a position she likes that also pays well. She wasn’t interested in doing that. I never brought it up again. The reason I posted here was because it’s been killing me wanting to start up the discussion again and I was looking to see if that would make me the asshole.

Let her take a break and recuperate for awhile and maybe she'll be ready for a challenge again. I get that it's stressful for you, but she's not just being lazy. She's trying to take care of her mental health. I assume she's at least seeing a therapist after the breakdown?","YTA. She had a mental breakdown ffs. I’m sure she’s not thrilled about a huge pay cut either, but if this is what she needs to do in order to avoid a *complete* breakdown that would make her unable to work at all, it’s very important you respect that. Try and muster a bit more compassion and understanding than you have so far. 

It’s not like the severely decreased salary has to be a permanent thing, she just needs time and space to breathe and focus on getting healthy. Her mental health should be a major priority during this time. Assuming she gets the help she needs, she’ll likely be able to handle a better-paying job in a less toxic work environment than the one that led her to her breakdown in a year or possibly even a bit sooner.

My sister that is watching him came up with this idea that she could nurse him. I was all for it. I loved the idea and wet nursing doesn’t creep me out. My husband on the other hand was against it. He found is creepy and didn’t like it. So we decided my sister would feed him my milk and supplement with formula.

I bought a can of formula and brought it over. Halfway through the first day back my sister ran out of breastmilk. She tried giving him the formula and he refused. She called me freaking out because he was hungry and wouldn’t stop crying. So I told her to nurse him. He was a happy camper.

The past 2 weeks I haven’t been necessarily lying to my husband but I haven’t told him the truth either. Tonight I figured it was time. He was furious because I went against his wishes. He thinks it creepy. He wants my sister to stop and for us to figure out another solution. I however want my sister to continue. 

So am I the asshole for having my sister nurse my son against my husband’s wishes?","YTA  for keeping this from your husband. ""So we decided my sister would feed him my milk and supplement with formula.""

aqv3vl,"We’ve been dating for a little more than 2 years and honestly my heart just isn’t in it. I love him but I know deep down that it’s just not going to work out, especially because I found myself having feelings for someone else.

I’m always terrible at breakups and I draw out the process way too much. So I want to dump him, and all I can think about is that it’s the day after Valentine’s Day and everyone is going to think I’m such an asshole. We’re long distance so we didn’t get each other anything and we didn’t celebrate but still, culturally, seems like a pretty shit date to do it. The fact that we didn’t celebrate yet almost makes it feel worse.

The worst part is he loves me so much and he’s already at an extremely stressful time in his life and I know this will only make things go much worse for him. Part of me thinks I should wait until his life is more stable so I can be slightly more confident that this won’t throw everything off track for him.

emgv6z,"UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM

Small summary.. my husband has a bit of a bath obsession, he'll come home from work and disappear into the tub for anywhere fron 30 minutes  to 1 or 2 hours, I've repeatedly told him this doesn't work out well since we'll have a 1 year old as of next month (whom I stay at home with all day) and a newborn any day now. 

We toured the hospital I was to deliver in this past week to make sure it was the right fit, I asked him at the end of the tour what he thought of the tour and the only thing he thought of to say was that the tubs were nice.. he couldn't wait to get into them. When I informed him the tub was for me to labor in and not for him to bath in he was upset. 

I can't seem to get the idea out of his head that he can't take a bath in the tubs and they're not for the father, he also refuses to believe that they won't let him in the tub as well when I'm delivering (there's various health reasons why plus I wouldn't like him all over me anyway) 

Am I in the wrong for being so against it? 

He's acting like I'm being unreasonable on this one but even my family seem to agree with me.

UPDATE* I've left my husband over this along with other issues and problems we had. Some of you redditors really did pick up on some underline issues and really helped open my eyes. My child is now here and doing very well, my husband however was not welcomed for the birth and never got his PRECIOUS tub time.

Update 2; It's been a year since making this post.. I look back and laugh at it from time to time but the kids and I are doing great now without him and we have our own place. 

His family blew up at us for not having him at the birth of 2nd child but I think it was well worth it.",NTA. But there is something very weird happening here. Also a bit crap that he is totally disregarding your wishes and needs. As you know you are the one birthing and should have all the says.,"NTA  WTF is wrong with him? I can't believe your husband is trying to make your labor and delivery a spa day for himself! He sounds pretty self involved and a bit of a narcissist. No, he doesn't belong in the tub with you. You'll be busy pushing a baby out of your body. You don't need him laying next to you pretending he's at a health spa. And I guarantee they're not going to let him take a freaking bath himself. You need to bring this up with your doctor, midwife, or whoever will be in charge during your labor and let them make it clear to him that his desire to lounge in the bath that day is absolutely inappropriate. He needs to be there as support for you and his focus during your labor and delivery should be 100% on you. You are definitely not the asshole here.",0,0
b2ecqn,"During university my roommates (also friends) were very bad at turning off lights in common areas. I had discussed it with them at length before but their logic was they weren't paying for utilities so who cares. Fair enough. 

The issue was that this meant sometimes when the bathroom light was on it didn't mean anyone was using it. We also tended to kept the bathroom door closed/open regardless of if it was not in use. Essentially what I'm getting at is that sometimes the bathroom door would be closed with the light on and no one in it. So I would often just try to door to see if it was in use. 

One day my friend has his girlfriend stay the night. That night I go to use the bathroom to brush my teeth and open the door and she standing their naked so I quickly close the door apologizing and head back to my room a bit embarrassed.  I tell my friend about what happened and he just said don't worry about it so I just forgot about it. 

The next day around noon (when I generally wake up) the same thing happens when I'm going to use the bathroom to brush my teeth again. This time my friend is in the living room so I look at him and just with a look of defeat say ""does she not know how to use the lock?""

He said that it was my fault for not checking if the light was on before trying the door and that I should be the one being more considerate

This kind of caused a fight between us cause it had happened multiple times. But neither was willing to take the blame. 

Just wondering if I'm TA here for being annoyed by this. ","NTA this is silly - any adult should know to lock the door when using the restroom. Honestly, I wouldn't even go by the light rule if it wasn't an issue. Lights get left on sometimes, even in households that are good about it. If they don't lock the door when using a communal bathroom, they're *going* to get walked in on, end of discussion."," NTA. You should check for a light but she shouldn’t lock the door??

ci75sp,"My girlfriend and I were invited to my GF's parents' house for a get together. Typical festivities ensue: eat barbecue, drink alcohol, etc. All of us gather in the living room for a show: a show about politics. My GF's parents are blatantly Republican, which I have no problem with. They proceed to voice their opinions about trivial matters involving sociopolitical nonsense featured on the show. I generally do not comment during these rants, but that day I thought, ""Hell with it. I'm bored. Let's throw a dissenting opinion to see where it goes. I'm curious of some of their reasons and I'd like to know more about what they think."" 

The conversation turned sour. GF's parents make comments about how they're concerned their son has turned Agnostic from Christian.  We go back and forth which leads to questions about my personal beliefs. Of course I don't want this to be about me, but I figured I would help GF's parents understand some of the contradictions one might find if they were to accept some concept, like Pascal's Wager (If I don't believe in God, I risk going to hell. If I believe in God, I stand to gain eternal bliss. Therefore I should always believe in God from this calculus.)  Then GF's parents ask me how I live if I do not have God in my life. I tell them I want to live in comfort and avoid boredom. They ask, ""So you would rather play video games all day?"" At this point, they know I have a crutch. Video games are comfort for me, but I perceived this comment as condescending. I stood up and declared, ""I think it's time for me to leave. You all have a good night."" 

I left promptly and walked 2 miles before GF retrieved me and drove us home. The parents followed us to our home and tried to make amends, but only confirmed my reaction.

cogtc2,"We were in a very nice outdoor shopping mall, and me and my bro were walking to the parking lot to get to our car. Which at the time was our relatively new Black BMW 7 Series. Before you call me a snob driving daddy's car, my dad pretty much told me to take this car for a spin since we were going to the posh snobby bits of town. (Yes, that's what I think of our CBD district)

I was parked in between a Mercedes E class and a Brand-Spanking-New White BMW 3 Series. I opened the driver's side door to get in. My brother does the same with the passenger side door in the back (He liked to sit there, it's much more luxurious in the back than the front) when suddenly I heard a car horn. It came from the white BMW. The driver got out, and I walked over to see what was the fuss. White BMW driver: DR, OP: Me, Brother: Bro

Me: Umm what's going on here?

DR: I think he (bro) hit my car with the passenger door. (That's when I noticed that my bro did in fact, swing the door in a very strong manner)

Me: (Shouts brother's name in frustration) Why did you do that!?

Bro: Uh... Uh...

Me: Okay that is quite a big ding you have on your car. Mine is okay. Do you want to exchange insurance details?

DR: You know what, it's fine. And he gets into his car again.

A couple of weeks later I ask him again.

Me: Why did you open that door so hard?

Bro: Why did you shout my name?

Me: Because you fucked up. You were clearly in the wrong.

Bro: You're wrong for embarrassing me and shouting my name. That was so embarrassing and I just died or disappeared there.

Me: Welp... You were still in the wrong.

AITA for shouting at my brother in that manner after I realised what he had done?

Edit: since I seem to be an asshole for asking my brother weeks later, I would like to say that it was because I wasn’t feeling well after dropping off my brother and his friend’s birthday party/sleepover. It wasn’t for a week.

The reason I bought it up was because we were somewhere and he said to me “that guy looks like the guy I accidentally dinged” and I was like “do you see his car? It’s not a white 3 series.”

ckpbms,"My roommate and I work at the same place and we work the same hours most of the time. I moved in with them a few months ago, so naturally we have been carpooling to work since then. Yesterday the topic of paying gas money came up. I thought it sounded reasonable at first but the more I thought about it, I realized I had an issue with it. 

First, I decided to do some calculations to see how much gas does it take us to get to work. I had my S.O. help with this part. I'm not great with math but they were a math major in college, so I'm fairly certain the numbers we came up with are pretty accurate. I checked the map and the usual route we take to see how many city and highway miles we would drive, and the amount of gas needed depending on the average mpg for each of our cars. Then we factor in an average price of gas for our city. I find that taking roommate's car would mean I'd pay roughly 1.10 for a ride and they would pay me about 1.50 for a ride, since they get a better mpg. 

Now, one dollar a day is pretty negligible. When I asked them what a fair payment for this would be (before I did the math), roommate said $2 a day. And still, a negligible amount of money for me. So what is the problem here? 

The way we have been deciding who will drive has everything to do with lunch. Our lunches are scheduled for us and most of the time my roommate and I do not have the same lunch times. This is not a problem for me because I bring my lunch to work every day. My roommate however, rarely brings their lunch, thus needs access to a car to eat out. There are no restaurants in walking distance, unless you'd like to buy lunch at a gas station or the dollar store. Having food delivered to work on a regular basis is not an option. Nor will I allow my roommate to drive my car without me present.

So if I try to plan the days in advance for me to drive so it's more equal, I would be forcing them to either grocery shop and pack lunch, or limiting them to the walkable options. So, if we work the exact same hours one week and roomie wants fast food every day for lunch, I'm going to get stuck paying. The decision is TOTALLY dependent on what they are doing for lunch. Am I going to tell my roomie ""I'm driving today and you are SOL if you don't want to walk to dollar general and buy a frozen meal.""? No, I am not. Driving two cars is stupid and wasteful. I do think it seems a bit unfair for one person to be purchasing the gas to get us both to work, even though nobody is getting picked up or dropped off at a different location, but I'd rather just split driving time. 

So, what do we think? Am I TA for not wanting to start paying?","YTA

wow that's an awful lot of words for ""i'm a stingy asshole""

help pay for gas or walk",YTA and you are petty as all get out. Settle on $25 a month flat rate and both be happy. This makes it closer to what you want to pay but still gives them some money for gas.,2,3
axxbt9,"So me and my partner have been together for over 4 years and he proposed to me a few months ago. We’ve had our ups and downs like any normal couple. The biggest point of friction has been his incel best friend but it's never been a dealbreaker for the relationship just friction. When he told me he wanted that guy to be his best man I told him I don’t feel comfortable with that and don’t want that guy as a best man end of story.

Now I didn’t do this without reason. I’m sure some of the unlucky ladies here will understand the situation of creepy friends of boyfriends. This is that scenario. The more I got to know this friend the less comfortable I felt around him. He’s over 35, complete virgin and never had a single relationship with a man, woman or whatever. Doesn’t own any pets and lives alone. I get the biggest incel vibe from him and that makes me uncomfortable. I’ve even looked at the incel subreddits and some of those people seem to have very unhealthy views which makes me even more uncomfortable. I’ve brought up that creepiness many times, but my fiance just doesn’t see it, but they’ve know each other since primary school plus most guys don’t pick up on that.

As a replacement I suggested one of his other close friends who he has known just as long but is happily married with a kid on the way. Or I’d even consider compromising and let him potentially choose my maid of honour from a list. I feel like this is more appropriate for a wedding to have people who know what it’s like to be in a loving relationship supporting the bride and groom.

My fiancé says it’s his choice and won’t budge on the choice but I believe both of us have to be completely comfortable with each other’s respective best man and maid of honour.

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE:

Seems you all can’t take my word that this guy is an incel and want more info. If you met him you’d see it and understand. I haven’t been able successfully limit his exposure to us, my fiance (he’s got such a big heart) likes him too damn much to see the flaws. I guess I could say he’s still allowed to be invited to the wedding or maybe be a groomsman but not the best man. I feel it’s fair that these are choices that both bride and groom have to agree on together.

For some more concrete examples of how this guy’s an incel:  
I once heard him telling my boyfriend something about a “safety net” saying his dad and him are proof of how spiteful “normal” women can get “she’ll die rich but we’re free”.  
I’ve also overheard him with “the guys” in the backyard saying women on Tinder are bitches for not looking past his quite prominent lip/palette cleft thing. I feel he’s taken no matches ever a bit too personally, I know ladies that have struggled to get matches on Tinder and aren’t bitter.

People who get to that age with a failure to launch have to have some issues in being properly socialised in things like general respect to women. I feel I’m entitled to not be forced to be around people I’m not comfortable being around with during our wedding day.","So essentially.. you have no proof at all and are extrapolating that he should be creepy because he's 35, alone and lives alone?

He also used me like a credit card, borrowing thousands of dollars and letting me buy all the groceries, but eventually paying me back when he worked. 

This last time he was gone longer than usual because his dad has Alzheimer’s and in that time I met someone else. I didn’t cheat but i spent a lot of time with this guy, telling myself we would just be friends but connecting with him really well.

dlk8fj,"My in laws had an early Halloween party on Sunday because some family members will be travelling on actual Halloween. There were many people invited, think a weird cross between Halloween/ Christmas / bbq and that’s basically what it was. 

There were a few unfamiliar faces, but not too many. I’ve been married for 7 years to my husband and we have a 5 y/o lil boy who’s overall very happy, bright, and confident. There was a lady who I’d never seen before and we ended up sitting next to each other outside as the party had spilled onto the decking. She sat down next to me asking a hundred questions about my son, his teeth (??), why he has long hair (because he likes it?) and why I was allowing him to pick food off his dads plate (because we love our son and are a close family...?) My son came running up to me after a few mins and said ‘daddy is calling you’ 

The reason why my husband didn’t come over himself is because he was sitting next to his very very ill and elderly aunt who actually introduced us. She was holding his hand smiling because she hadn’t seen him in a while and he was calling me over because she’d asked after me. 

After I returned the lady said ‘you ought to home school your boy. He’s got some nerve talking to you the way he did.’ I was surprised and said excuse me? He wasn’t at all rude or anything. She repeated herself and pointed to her child, who had been going *nuts* running around other kids and said ‘she’s polite and knows how to talk to adults.’ 

I must admit by the time this happened I was onto my second glass of wine, so I screwed up my nose and said ‘thanks but no thanks, I find the idea of home schooling weird, and my son knows perfectly well how to talk to people’ 

She immediately spluttered and tried to defend her position, saying ‘I’m only trying to help!’, but by this point I decided to walk off because she was really gearing up and already spouting about statistics and Christianity etc etc. 

I think I’ll probably be called TA but let’s give it a whirl. My husband is 100% on my side but my MIL got a phone call about my ‘improper behavior’ and she wants me to Facebook friend this lady to apologize.","NTA.   She openly criticized your child for doing something extremely normal. You didn’t pick on or criticize her kid, you were just short with her when she tried to use home schooling as a way to say “my kid is better than your kid, your kid doesn’t know how to behave”.  Which is something she’d clearly spent the whole conversation wanting to say.  You could have returned the favor and picked apart her child, but you didn’t, you simply rebuffed her completely out of linen assertion about your child.

I said yes to going to the dance, and told one of my online friends that I was excited to have some friends to go with, since this is my second ever school dance.

bb2xou,"I'm M22, She's F21 and I met her on tinder and she was really pretty, body pics, face pics, bikini pics and she had a great body as well. We spoke for like a week and then met up last friday night at a bar near me as she was around meeting up with a friend earlier. She got there before me and said she got a table beside the window and was wearing red. I walk in and look around to the part of the bar she said she was at, and I don't see anyone resembling her pics, there's a large girl in red so I sheepishly approach her and say her name in a confusing tone. She gets up and gives me a hug and I was pretty confused at this point, I sit down and we talk for a bit and we order some beers and food and I was having a good time. She began to open up that she had some sort of medical condition and because of meds she's put on a lot of weight, like she's around 250 if I had to guess and maybe 5'7. I was having a good time but I just was not feeling it because of her weight and if she had been truthful with me from the start I never would have agreed to a date. About 1 hour in I make up an excuse of having to go to my buddies bday party and needed to leave. We split the cheque and it was kind of abrupt and I think she knew why I ended the night short.

bkbfzt,"Hello,

I have been re-seeing an ex girlfriend again for a few months. She and I are going to a wedding together. The original plan was for her to today (Friday) and me to drive down separately to join her on Saturday for the wedding. Its about a 4 hour drive.

Its been finals week for both of us the last two weeks. She had two papers due today (Friday) and one paper and an exam on the days preceding, so she has definitely had a lot on her plate (though so have I). She was pretty stressed about finishing the two papers by today and didn't sleep much last night to get them done.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night (Thursday) at about 8pm she asked if I could move my plans up to drive her Friday morning since she knew she'd have to basically stay up all night to finish her two papers. Normally I would consider myself the asshole for not agreeing to help her out, but she has sort of procrastinated these papers and took a 3 day trip last week to see a show in a different city with a friend. Admittedly, she worked on the two papers on this trip but she didn't have to go and could have instead worked on these papers. I don't think its fair for me to move around all my plans to bail her out for her poor habits. Am I the asshole?","NAH... you had plans, go ahead and keep them. Why can't she come down w/ you on Saturday?","NTA, although not driving her may drive a wedge between the two of you.

ct6x7f,"Alright so I (29M) am slated to be a groomsman in my good friend's wedding at the end of November. We live about 2000 miles apart now so I have to spend quite a bit of money getting there and lodging, tux, food, drinks etc. I have been trying to save money here and there for the trip, but things are a bit tight and we don't really have much of a savings right now. For more context, my friends and I are not as close anymore as they are all still doing what we were doing ten years ago. Totally fine, I realize we're all in different life stages, but it is much harder to connect with them anymore because I don't party at all anymore. 

We found out a couple of weeks ago that my wife is pregnant with our first baby!! We're both super excited, but the big $0 in our savings account has been creating some fear to say the least. The immediate way I thought to save some money was to just bail on this wedding entirely and save that (probably like $1000) money for baby. I have no idea when I will see my friends again and they are going to understand why I wont be there, but it will definitely be a huge fork in the road for us, me skipping this wedding.

dbce57,"Morning, y’all. 

This post is actually more of an are *we* the *assholes*. 

There are seven of us kids, between the ages of 23 and 35. Six of us are into health and fitness. Five of us actually pursued careers in it (RN, dietician, PE teacher, physical therapist, and personal trainer). One of the others works as a carpenter, while the last is beautician. 

Well, coming from a small town, there really isn’t a gym available after you leave high school. The closest thing is the YMCA, and it’s about an hour away and doesn’t have much. A little over a year ago, I (29m, former PE teacher) and my five other siblings who are interested in exercise and the like decided to start a gym. The runt (23f, personal trainer) was already basically running one out of a gym bag, so we figured it was worth a shot. 

We offered my middle sister (27f, beautician), I’ll call her Kim, a place in the business, but she refused. 

Well, as businesses do, the gym has a way of creeping into our conversations. It’s where we spend most of our time, so it’s where most of our lives take place. Whether we’ve got a funny story or an issue, it comes from there. 

Kim is upset. We’re spending more time together as a group, but even when we tell her it’s work stuff, she wants to join in. Then, when she gets there, she complains about what we’re talking about. 

We’ve had to start not mentioning when we’re doing work meetings in front of her. We’ve tried instituting a “no work talk” rule when we’re with her, but it ends up us just sitting in silence. 

About a week ago, Kim approached us about joining the business. Now, let me be blunt: Kim is not into working out. She’s one of the most sedentary people I know. She doesn’t want to become interested in fitness. She’s “just tired of being left out.”

I get it. We’re all each other has in terms of family, and she’s not feeling part of it anymore. But this is our *business*, and I don’t want to jeapardize it by bringing in someone who has no knowledge about or passion for it. 

Are we being dicks here?


Edit: Allow me to explain y’all a bit more about the “no work talk” rule. Let’s say Billy came in to workout, and he told us that Rick isn’t running for re-election this year. Kim doesn’t want us talking about this because we got the information at work, even though we were talking about the upcoming elections anyway. If we see something, and it reminds us of a funny story, we can’t tell it. If a guy flirts with the runt during a session, we can’t talk about it. Etc.","NAH

My sister and I started a business.  We haven't had any hurt feelings from our other 2 siblings, really. We're all spread out, so that helps. 

But we too have tried to limit work talk while we're all together.  We try to do it when it's just us.

I can see how Kim feels left out, being 1 of 7.  She does need to understand it's listen to work stuff or don't come to the work stuff events, which will be frequent.

OTOH, so she doesn't work out.  Is there anything she can contribute?  She's a beautician.  Is she artistic?  None of the other professions scream creative to me (note, I am not creative either, artistically).  Her contribution doesn't have to be fitness related.  She could work on branding, marketing, or even create an addition to the business based on her background.  I could see going to my gym, having a sauna afterwards, then getting a haircut, shave, and/or massage if there was a spa attached.","NTA

aecerl,"Hey guys, so since November, my girlfriend of 4 years and I were planning to go to somewhere for a 3-day weekend before school starts (Vegas, Lake Tahoe, LA). Shit had hit the fan because last semester I joined a business fraternity where I had became friends with many people. Beforehand, my girlfriend had occupied so much of my time, we'd talk 6-8 hours a day and had led me losing any of my close friends. When the semester started, I loss touch with her, I became more involved with my fraternity and shit had hit the fan because she became jealous of other girls that I was getting to know (not flirting or anything, but becoming friends with), so as the semester ended we tried fixing my issues of lack of communication and openness. 

Cue the end of December and my fraternity announces a retreat to Tahoe, to potentially party, have very fun moments and really develop bonds with other people in the fraternity I haven't gotten to know. It is on the same date that my girlfriend and I had originally planned to go on vacation together, and I was torn in between these two events. For one thing, I had never had gone on such a trip with friends and for another thing it's from what I hear something people in my fraternity won't forget. So I am allured to that idea. I feel like going on a trip with my girlfriend is so expensive FWIW (Each of us are looking at $500 which is not really wise for both of us who are in college, in comparison to $55, but I can't bring her). I also feel like there may be fights and horrible experiences just because are relationship is just pulling itself back together. In fact, we just started planning this 2 days ago when it should have been 1 month ago minimum. 

Deep inside I just wanted to have fun on a trip that I may not be able to experience again, and I was hoping my girl can trust me, but she can't because I had deleted a text to another girl saying Happy thanksgiving"" when I told my gf I wouldn't reply back. It seems crazy and childish, but a lot of trust was lost because I was replying to other girls texts before her. I wasn't trying to get with any of these girls, it just feels so great being friends with new people again after so long. In other words, I've been in a controlling relationship and I just started having these experiences. I haven't told my gf that I wanted to go to the retreat, I really don't want to hurt her feelings, but that's really what I think. AITA? 

Thanks Reddit","YTA.

You had already committed to the trip with your girlfriend. To back out now because you’d rather go and party with your mates is 100% asshole behaviour. It sounds like you’re making up a load of excuses as to why the trip with your girlfriend wouldn’t be a good idea, but it basically boils down to you’d rather go with your friends. 

Maybe you need to evaluate whether you really want a girlfriend right now. You don’t sound like you’re really interested in saving the relationship. That’s totally fine if that’s how you feel, it’s your life and you have to do what makes you happy, but put her out of her misery and end it already if that’s the case. 

If that’s not the case and you want to stay with her, then you need to deal with the FOMO and put the effort in. There will be plenty of other opportunities to go out with mates",YTA to bail on plans but honestly I think you should leave her and go on the fraternity trip. It sounds like she makes you miserable.,1,1
alng4g,"So my gf and I(33) have a habit of checking each other's phones (whether this is right or wrong is another discussion) and i finally snapped and confronted her about this. She has a divorce finalizing and she told her sister (this I understand) and her 2 friends (of 3 years or so) about it. She has a court date next month and as soon as she found out about it guess who she told, her friends and sisters. She took one of her boys to the ER (nothing serious) and guess what? The funny thing about this one is the text she sent them looked identical to what she sent me. Apparently she copy and pasted. 

Now I know you guys will say ""yta"" right about now but hear me out. he wanted to get bunk beds for her boys. She sat there and had a whole conversation with her older sister and her 2 friends (separate conversations). A few days later she tells me ""oh I want to get the boys bunk beds"" not discussing it in the least with me. 

There's times she'll message or call me all excited and I'm glad she's sharing this with me only to find out she did the same with guess who her sisters and her 2 friends. 

I have an older brother, younger sister and a best friend and they don't know shit. I know I know people are different and I don't expect her to be like me.

afbjn5,"Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. I have been married for years, have 3 children, one is a teenager, the other 2 are 4 and under. My husband works, I stay at home. Am I being unrealistic in expecting a little help? I cook, clean, do all shopping, and childcare. I'm up with them every day, and I put them to bed every night. I love my kids, please dont tell me I shouldnt have had them. They are my world. My husband will on occasion bathe the younger two (maybe once a month?) He works a crazy schedule which requires him to work 12 hr shifts sometimes during the day, sometimes overnight. Regardless of work or not, I get up with the kids every day. On his days off, he gets up leisurely,  takes a shower, and joins us after. I spend a part of my day cleaning up behind him. He leaves his clothes everywhere (living room, all over the bathroom, our bedroom floor). He spends the day generally in the same room with us, but often on the phone either playing games or whatnot, unless football is on. I should be going to bed when the kids do, because I know I have to get up with them. But sometimes it's hard to just immediately fall asleep and I'm up until 11 or so (Kids are up by 6-7) . 

He doesn't like night shift, and has made it obvious he'd like to be off that shift. I tried to approach him today about either setting up a plan with his bosses or helping him look for a new job. He has a bachelor's,  I only have an associate's. His response was if I need a break, I need to get a job and put the kids in daycare. I just don't see that as a fix. Finally he agreed he would just do the laundry,  so I didn't have to. But it feels more like a tantrum than anything. He says anyone would die to be in my position. 

Let me say this, I love my husband. Hes a good dad. I know he loves his kids. 

I'm happy to give more answers, I honestly just want to know....is this right? Am I supposed to live day in and day out without a break, because he pays the bills? AITA for even bringing it up? ","NTA. NOT THE ASSHOLE!!! He works long hours- you work *nonstop* hours. He gets at least a day off each week, when is your day off?

He is a grown-ass man, he can do some laundry once in a while. ","NTA. I am in a similar situation but from your husband's side. When our youngest was born we decided it made more sense for me to support the family and my wife be stay at home mum until youngest entered full time education.
I get that I need to do things to not add to my wife's burden of housekeeping. It sound like your husband doesn't. I know I'm not a perfect husband and my household standards are not the same as my wife's so some friction surfaces at times. So we discuss it, I get to recognise when I am being a slob but I remind my wife that she is free to manage her time and set her priorities herself. I recognise that stay at home mum is an on going job and not a life of leisure.
Moving on, my wife started a part time job last year so we can build up some money to use for leisure activity, we aren't on the breadline but we aren't able to jet set either. She he suggested that she would prefer to go back. What I am getting at is you can work at your own pace as stay at home mum but you are under pressure as an employee.

brdmmy,"My boyfriend has been really into the gym and weightlifting lately, which I fully support - I’m a part of a few sports teams myself and love that he has a hobby and is being healthy.

However, his timings have really annoyed me. He keeps having massive weightlifting sessions just before events and trips, which inevitably results in him being in too much pain to do anything, particularly after leg day.

We recently went to Budapest for a long weekend and we had a whole itinerary planned. A couple of nights before we left, he had his leg day. He spent the whole time limping and complaining about the pain and we ended up doing just two of the things we had planned. By the Sunday I snapped and told him, in summary, that I didn’t care he was in pain, because he did it to himself and that I was fed up with listening to him whine and sitting around doing nothing, all because he refused to reschedule leg day.

He got very upset with me and said I was being unsupportive, that I cared more about our itinerary (which we made together by the way) than I do about him.

We got home last week and we’re in this weird standoff where neither one of us will apologise, nor let it go, so it’s been pretty icy to say the least.

AITA here? Should I have been more flexible? Should I apologise?","NTA- edited to add this. It's not your fault he sucks both at the gym and at managing his own commitments.

INFO, what the fuck kind of lifting routine is your boyfriend doing where he is limping for DAYS after a workout?!","NTA - Title made me think I was going to lean you're TA because I like to lift and a workout done is better than nothing.

ecpyif,"My daughter is 19. She’s studying biomedical engineering at a great university, but has told me for the past couple of years that her dream is to become a famous actress. I get it. If I had her looks when I was young, I would probably fantasize about that being my career too. I fully support her to leave no stone unturned. My daughter had been eyeing her first open call audition for a recurring role in a drama series for two months now. I find that part to be perfect for her. 


My daughter usually has very clear skin, but I’m guessing she’s quite stressed out from final exams and the audition. When she came back home last Saturday, she had a huge cystic nose pimple that looked painful. She kept whining about it and kept praying for it go down by Wednesday, the day of the audition. She has been icing her nose constantly for the past few days. It has gone down quite a bit. 


She kept saying she will skip the audition if the pimple is still inflamed. I told her that it won’t be as noticeable under stage makeup and it doesn’t really detract from her beauty and talent at all. She kept saying that the pimple makes her nose look bulbous and is a huge distraction. I kept assuring her that it isn’t as big of a deal as she is making it out to be. I ran some lines with her every day. I could tell she had been practicing a lot. 


Today was the big day. She woke up and said she couldn’t go to the audition because her nose still looks awful under heavier makeup. There’s no chance of her getting blackballed for flaking because it’s an open call audition so anyone could just show up, but I told her that her nose got much better and she needs to not let anything get in the way of her dreams. 


She kept trying to back down so I told her that either I will drive her to the audition or she will drive herself there and take a photo of herself at the audition waiting room. My husband wanted me to take it easy on her, but ultimately let me make the decision. My daughter said she’ll drive there herself because I was stressing her out. She took a photo of herself in front of the company sign at the audition. Her nose pimple really doesn’t look noticeable. It’s mostly in her head. 


She came back and told me she didn’t feel too good about her audition. She said she was super nervous. They’ll give her a call within the next two weeks if they want her back. I said I was sure she did great because I knew she put the work in. I asked her if she was glad I made her go, and she said she’s probably not getting the part either way. I then gave her a pep talk. 


My husband said I might be a little too pushy and to should give our daughter more agency. I have never seen myself as pushy, strict, or what have you, but I didn’t like that my daughter was talking herself out of something she really wanted just because of a minor roadblock.","NAH I get why you pushed her, but at the end of the day, she's an adult and the only one who has to deal with potential regret of not going is her","Your daughter is an adult and not only can make her own decisions, but she should. If she skipped and regretted it, that's a valuable lesson to learn, but instead her parent made the decision for her, and she probably even resents that at least a little.

a3k7l4,"I went on [Twitch.tv](https://Twitch.tv) last night to browse through streams. My country is rather small and therefore the ""big"" streamers only average about 50 people at night.  I was bored and just picked the streamer with the most views, because the chat and streamer interaction are usually pretty funny anyways. I hopped into this female streamers stream to check it out and get a feel for the community. She was playing Golf with friends, with really loud music blaring, making her almost unintelligible. The chat was mostly mods and year old subs ""fishing"" for her attention. At this point, I decided to joke a bit and posted the emote ResidentSleeper in the chat. She apparently took it very personally and told me to just leave if I think the stream is boring. She gave me a chat time out for two minutes. After it ran out I wrote:

""Damn, I tried to leave but fell asleep before I managed to click the 'X'""

She perm-banned me while her chat kept asking if I was dropped on my head etc. while she was telling me that I was immature and should enjoy my 5 minute fame. I chuckled and went on my way.

Later this night, I was once again doing the same thing, where I was looking through streams and hopped into the most viewed again. I saw her chatting and wrote ""@(female streamer) Oh god, I almost fell asleep just reading your messages in chat""

She told me I was immature etc. while the streamer saw my post and asked what was going on. I said I was just joking, but he got visibly mad, told me to shut my fucking mouth because I'm the kind of dude no one wants in their chat.

I was kinda blown back made me think for a minute. I just left the stream while everyone called me a hater and spammed the streamers name and hearts. I came back 30 minutes later asking why everyone got so mad. I was just told to ""Just stop fucking trolling. Just fucking don't.""

Am I the asshole? The chat and streamers seem more toxic than me, but this sticks with me for some reason.

c776wn,"Hey guys so I love this sub and usually agree with the answers,  so let me know what you think about this situation.

So my girlfriend and I went out to eat tonight at a Korean BBQ place. Just a little background for those that don't know, at this place you sit next to a gas grill and cook raw meat that you order off the menu.  

Anyways, so while cooking I was cutting the meat and getting ready to serve it to us, but while cutting it, I pulled too hard, and a drop of the oil on the grill flew up and landed on my girlfriend's cheek. Of course she immediately held her cheek and said, ""ow that hurt"" and I realized what happened and this is where we disagree if what I did was right. 

So first I immediately said sorry, and asked if she was okay. She said no because it was still hurting.

At this point I was thinking everyone has had some meat juice from a grill or ember from a fire land on them and it hurts for a few seconds then stops. So at this point I figured she was going to be okay in a few seconds so I said sorry again and continued to eat. 

After my bite I realized she was staring at me in a very upset way and we started arguing.

From her perspective she thinks I did a terrible job empathizing, and I should have worried about her more. For example she said I should have asked how bad does it hurt, is it starting to feel better or other questions along those lines instead of just starting to eat again so soon. 

I can sort of understand where she's coming from, but from my view it was something I knew wouldn't hurt for very long, as I think everyone has had this happen to them at some point or another. I also thought it was weird I needed to keep asking questions that I sort of thought were meaningless until she said I could eat again. She has said after about 10 seconds it didn't hurt and if I had just waited, then she wouldn't have been so upset, but because I ate, she thought I didn't empathize with her enough.  

In my view I knew she would be okay in a few seconds, and I also knew there wasn't anything I could do immediately to make it feel better, so I continued with my dinner. 

So what do you guys think? Was she being a little too sensitive? or was I the asshole for not empathizing well? I know sometimes I struggle with that so I'm willing to accept my judgement.

Sorry for any spelling mistakes, I am from Belgium.

Just a little context; I will soon graduate, and I was planning to move in with my girlfriend after that (she also lives in Belgium). So, as a fresh start, I want to shave my head. My girlfriend has always been honest with me over her fear of change and I never did anything extreme so she didn't have to worry. I did always fantasize about shaving or cutting my hair, because I feel rather masculine and I want to try around.

Now, today I have mentioned I want to shave my head, and focus on myself and my identity. She didn't seem to like that, she never liked when I talked about changing myself, always seemed kinda negative about it. I think it's perfectly normal for me wanting to try around, but she doesn't want me to, at all.

cmw7qr,"I went to a music festival last weekend here in town, and I probably saw 100 people I knew from all areas of life. Ran into guys I played road hockey with, girls I had crushes on in junior high, cousins, coworkers, you name it.

I am horribly bad with names, and I've admitted this to people many, many times. I've tried the memory games, they don't stick. The last few years I've made myself just tell the person I can't remember their name, apologize, and explain the ol' memory box only holds lyrics and Simpson's quotes, and maybe a birthday or three. Most times, this goes over well enough, even though it is embarrassing as all hell for me. I own it, I can take it.

Anyway, I am at this festival, many drinks and jazz cigarettes deep, and a fairly healthy edible. I am feeling no pain, having some fun, and seeing tons of people.

I was kind of awkward back in high school. I was chubby, with long emo style hair, quiet, talked funny and didn’t have too many friends. I was a kind of a target for bullies, both guys and girls. One of the girls, let’s call her J was kind of mean to me in a weird kind of way. She would pick on on me when others were around and when it was just us 2 (which was often because we both got to school early) she would kind of make fun of me in a condescending way while pretending to be nice. I can’t really explain it but I could always tell she was mocking me. The most embarrassing thing she ever did to me was walk up to me and say “if you let me touch your tits I’ll let you touch mine” in front of a bunch of people. Being awkward of course I put my head down and said no. Everyone laughed. I’ve never forgotten that moment.

Anyways that was all over a decade ago. Nowadays I’m more confident and happy, I’ve lost weight, I look good and feel good. I have a good job and hobbies that make me happy and feel fulfilled. I am successful and close to having my dream career. I have gotten on Instagram recently, and been posting about my life. I have been getting a lot of old classmates following me. One of which was J. She’s still good looking, she has a kid and is a single mother. She commented on one of my pictures, we chatted and that eventually led to DMing. I won’t bore you with details but a couple of weeks later we hung out, and I slept with her. The entire time we talked though I couldn’t stop remembering how she teased me in high school and how I went home and cried. 

we went out a few more times and I slept with her a few more times. I don’t know why but I started feeling more and more jaded each time I saw her. One night we were hanging out and I had this rage building in me, even though she had already apologized. That night we were at a bar watching a game and I excused myself to the bathroom but just left. She called me but I ignored her. I was already a bit drunk but I got home and drank a lot of tequila and I felt like I had to get it off my chest, I made a post on Instagram, saying something to the effect of “you laughed at me in high school, who’s laughing now?! Hit it and quit it” then I tagged her. 

She responded with “wtf” then blocked me, a few other people we went to school with also unfollowed me. A bunch of other people all commented asking me what happened and what was wrong with me. Then one comment really hit me, someone commented saying “I don’t know the story, but I don’t know that you’re no where near as happy as your posts suggest, I feel sorry for you”

After that I deleted my entire account and lost all my likes and followers but I felt embarrassed. Was I an asshole here?

I ended up suggesting a DVD set of this show I know she loves which was going to be my birthday gift for her but whatever. I'll come up with something else, I have months. In this convo he also asked me what I wanted. I was annoyed because I had shipped my gift for all of them like a week beforehand so it would get there on time. I couldn't think of anything in the moment because I was still doing holiday things for my husband and very stressed so I said ""idk I guess nothing"". So that's exactly what I got. Not even a text even though I wished him merry Christmas on the day. Now I'm considering ignoring his birthday but itll be obvious I'm ignoring it because my brother's birthday is one day after our dad's. So if I get dad a gift itll be clear I'm snubbing my brother. But I'm angry at my brother for being thoughtless and honestly a little bitter about how he treats my mom while living with her buts that's a different post for a different sub. So WIBTA for snubbing my brother on his birthday?

Edit:
People have asked if I'm ready to burn bridges with my brother over this and honestly the answer is yes. It's been years of me being thoughtful and kind with nothing reciprocated. We haven't been close since I went away to school at 18. That makes this now 7 years of either no gifts or meaningless nothings while I am always going out of my way to be kind. I didn't even get anything from him when I got married! Maybe if this was one mistake in an otherwise good relationship i wouldn't be so annoyed but I'm sick of this dynamic in my family in which the women plan and are giving and the men are thoughtless and scrambling at the last minute. I'll be getting my father the gift I planned and ignoring my brother. If he has a problem then he can reach out to me

Edit 2:
I realized none of you matter and neither does my relationship with my brother. The women in your lives aren't unending fountains of compassion and understanding. Quite frankly, I kind of like hurting people's feelings and this will be a good chance to do it. Thanks for the votes!",I know this is quite a serious situation but this would be the perfect opportunity to get him the gag gift of “nothing”. That way you did get a gift for him but it was nothing.

bw6bbk,"I have known this friend of mine for 14 years since secondary school times and she has been an avid drinker and smoker ever since 16 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

when she turned 24 she got married, she shared with me that she intends to try for a baby, me as a friend advised her multiple times to quit her smoking and drinking as it has been shown that it will increase the chances of miscarriage.

&amp;#x200B;

As expected during her first two pregnancy she did not heed my advices and she would continue to drink and smoke as how she likes, claiming that she needs these to de-stress herself from her job and i advised her that there are other healthier means of de-stressing other than smoking and drinking, but all advise given were ignore and both pregnancy ended up in miscarriage.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally the third time she got pregnant, i told her to please stop doing harm to both you and the baby and stop all smoking and drinking. i even asked my wife who is a nurse to send me those reserach articles that have proven that smoking and drinking reduces the chance of a successful pregnancy.

&amp;#x200B;

But she ignored my advice the third time and continued with her vices, literally at this point i have given up and stop giving her advise, as expected the third pregnancy is unsuccessful and it became a miscarriage again.

&amp;#x200B;

After knowing she had a third miscarriage, my friend decided to start blasting me saying that its all my fault that i have caused her to miscarriage, blocked me off on all social media, told all my friends that i caused her miscarriage, causing some of my friends to block me off as well.

ebok0m,"My fiancé’s best friend/best man is planning a surprise bachelor party for him. 

The best man wrote me and asked for a list of the groomsmen so he’d make sure he invited everyone. 

My younger brother is one of the groomsmen and is a recovering alcoholic in his third month of sobriety, just back to college after having to sit out a semester from the disease, and working very hard to stay on track. 

He and my fiancé are close and he’s been looking super forward to his first bachelor party, but decided he shouldn’t attend if it would be centered around drinking because he didn’t feel he was ready to handle being the only sober one in a group of drunk people. 

I found out when talking about guest list and plans that the best man was basically planning a night of poker and drinking games, so I asked him if he could do that some other night with just my fiancé and their friends and make the bachelor party a dry thing. 

He was pissed and said he shouldn’t have to plan two separate events just to accommodate one person and that it wouldn’t be a legit bachelor party without booze. I told him if he wasn’t up to the task, someone else could plan it, because there had to be a dry party. 

Now that I’ve had some time to sit with it I’m worrying it wasn’t my place to insist on this. I know my little brother would’ve been really hurt to not go to the bachelor party, but this isn’t his wedding, it’s my fiancé’s, but I do want him to have a good time and not be excluded because of his sobriety. 

I can’t talk to anyone about it without spoiling the surprise. AITA?",YTA there doesn’t have to be a dry party. He has to either control himself around the alcohol or decide to not go. He can do something else special with your fiancé that’s more one-on-one if he feels left out!,YTA. I was under 21 when my sister got married and 1 other bridesmaid didn't drink.

While my sister and her ex have been split for quite a long time, we always got along with him and he's truly a great father.  My sister and her boyfriend like to drink and when they do, they fight and argue; behavior I will not tolerate in my home around my own kids.

After a few days of them being here, my family and I are going out of town and they will have full access to my house like a airbnb.

ecxehx,"
I am a high school Junior, and this month my class had to write essays about whatever winter holidays we celebrate. About what our traditions are and what traditions we want to carry forwards into our futures. 

Now, I don't have good memories of the holidays, it's always been really stressful and a lot of pressure. My mom and step dad fight a lot, they have a lot of issues, and when we see the extended family, there is so much pressure to look ""normal"" and OK and basically lie out our teeth or else be an embarrassment to the family. My parents have lost it on my for telling my aunt that I don't do any sports anymore because I don't have a ride home. Or for telling my uncle I don't know how to cook anything. All true but apparently that stuff is shameful.

It's also stressful because I don't really like a lot of my family, last year my grandma who I really was close with passed away, and all of her 6 kids and their spouses (my parents and my aunts and uncles) fought over her stuff like a bunch of vultures, it was so disrespectful and I didn't want a part in it. My parents were pissed about that too, If I'd come over and taken turns picking stuff like the rest of the family, they could of gotten a few more things they wanted for themselves. This all happened around Thanksgiving / Christmas time.

So I wrote in my essay about how holidays are stressful and uneasy for me, and If want to wipe the slate clean and start totally fresh with my own traditions when I get a car. 

I want to do road trips, with friends who I know don't have a good time at home over the holidays. Make new traditions of travel and freedom and peace, with good people who want to be with each other instead of feeling like they have to be. I'd want to do stuff like go somewhere warm, have the adventure of picking a direction and driving till you can't drive any more, seeing where you end up. I'd like to get back to nature sometimes, explore cities sometimes. I want to do something that I can feel excited for beforehand, and have good memories of afterwards.

I thought it was a good essay, it was honest and I thought it was one of the most well written things I've done for class.

And my teacher didn't like it at all. She said I didn't understand what the essay was, that I didn't understand what a tradition was, that going somewhere different each year isn't a tradition. 

She was convinced there was something I would want to continue, that my family had done. Food, gifts, Christmas music, whatever. And I said no, I wanted my traditions to be all new, not a reminder of anything that didn't make me feel happy and relaxed.

Anyway, I got a D on the essay which is the worst grade I've ever gotten in English, and I think that's not fair. I feel like my teacher gave me a bad grade because I have different opinions than her.

AITA for standing by what I wrote in my essay? Is my teacher being an asshole?","NTA: 

You need to explain to your teacher that this prompt doesn’t apply to you, that Christmas/ the holidays is not a happy time for you. You do not need to justify it as this is common for many people.

Your teacher shouldn’t be insisting on it and punishing you for not having “traditions.”

Please talk to him/ her again and ask if you can be given a different prompt. If they don’t budge I would go to the guidance counselor/ principal because this is majorly unfair. 

You shouldn’t have to lie and make up some fairytale story for an essay. Not everyone has the same experiences and your teacher sounds ignorant.

e5uddo,"So 5 years ago my roommate got hit by a snow plow and tore his labrum in his shoulder. He just had surgery on it this past September, and has been doing PT. 

I'm glad he's on the right path to recovery after so many runarounds with different doctors, but he still isnt doing chores claiming it hurts his shoulder, ie doing the dishes or using a vacuum. 

It's been almost 3 months, i feel like the muscle itself should be fully healed and PT should have him strong enough to pick up some dirty dishes...

AITA?

EDIT: He told me he's worked up to lifting 40lb dumbbells in PT","YTA.

A serious muscle injury will take a lot longer to heal than a broken bone. The muscle cannot be immobilised for a length of time like a bone can. 

Doing a simple chore like washing some dishes can very easily aggravate the injury, and cause the muscle to swell, resulting in pain. 

I have a muscle injury - my lower back on the left side. It’s been two and a half years and I’m only about half way through a recovery. 

Your roommates injury will heal, but it will likely take a lot longer than three months. I’d expect a full recovery in around 12 months. 

If he’s able to do a chore with one hand, then he can do that. He can put clothes into the washing machine and turn it on. He can take the clothes out and put them in the dryer.
He can scrub the toilet bowl with one arm, and he can put away dishes with one arm. 

But don’t push him to do chores that in all likelihood will just aggravate his injury and cause him pain.

Edit: According to what I’ve read, it will take up to six weeks for the labrum to reattach itself to the bone, and another six weeks to strengthen. After that, you have to be very careful not to stress the injury - being so recently healed means there’s a higher risk of reinjury.","NTA. You are asking him to do chores, not jumping jacks or pull-ups. Plenty of chores can also be done with one arm (vacuuming, laundry, dusting, etc.).",3,0

eo18su,"REPOST CAUSE I DIDNT LIKE TITLE AND REFORMATTED IT

My sister has her first serious BF and she had him over for dinner a couple nights ago. The day of the dinner my parents were gonna meet him she came to me and basically asked if I could not be my ""weird and annoying self"" around him. Not gonna lie I was kinda mad cause being annoying has been a big insecurity for me but I told her I was gonna try. I am a bit clumsy person and can mess up anything at almost anytime and any awkward situation my go to is to act silly or ""weird"" as my sister would put it.  My sister dressed it up in pretty word but she meant ""hide your autism cause I think its weird"".   I am not on the spectrum but I'm close and probably have social awkwardness or aspergers but its undiagnosed and frankly IDC if I do or don't.

So her BF came over and things went well but I accidentally knocked over a cup of water. Whenever I'm in an awkward situation I start to act a bit weird and make jokes, I probably would have just stayed quiet or said sorry but then I remembered my sister telling me to not b weird and it got me mad again.  I cracked a couple jokes about me knocking over the cup and her SO actually laughed but I could tell it was more of a pity laugh.

The rest of the night went by alright but my sister talked to me when he left and she called me an ass for acting weird around her BF. I told her it was an accident and that it hurts my feelings when you call me weird.  She said that she will blame me if their relationship doesn't work cause of family and how its annoying that I couldn't be normal for 1 day.  I flipped her off and went to my room cause I was PISSED that she would say that stuff about me.

AITA?","NTA. Your sister shouldn't have talked to you that way. 

Whether you're on the spectrum or not, your personality is your own, and as long as you're not being mean or hurting anyone, nobody should be making you feel like there's something wrong with your just because you're a little different. 

It sounds like you and your sister are probably both pretty young, so hopefully this is something she'll stop doing as the two of you get a little older. In the meantime, though, it might be good to let her know that what she said hurt your feelings. You don't have to yell at her or have a fight over it, but just remind her that you can't help being who you are, and it hurts to know she isn't just totally accepting and loving you as you are.","

During the course of our ldr I've visited him a few times and we were thinking that he'd come for spring break next year and I will come to see him whenever I get the leave from work too. 

The catch is that he's bad with planning and not great with money. Usually I don't mind being the one who organises and plans stuff but I feel like he's not trying to do something here. I asked him if he had a plan for how he's gonna save up, how much money he'll need, etc, and he doesn't. I'd help him if he came to me and showed some initiative and desire to plan the trip, because I see how he could struggle especially with the money aspect of it. But he's not doing that. I feel like I have to make him sit down and discuss it or make the plan myself and just tell him what he needs to do or he'll end up realizing somewhere in the spring that money for the trip and tickets didn't appear on his table somehow and come running to me to tell me that he can't make it because the situation didn't not resolve itself (shocker).

A couple weeks ago she emailed him and said she was so sorry, but the only day their dream wedding venue was available was the week before our wedding, and they really couldn’t pass that up.

I feel like I’m not being unreasonable, especially since she planned her wedding so much after we had set our date; and because she even said she wouldn’t be upset if we didn’t go. My fiancé is still thinking about whether he is going to go or not, but I just feel like it’s really unfair for him to leave me with all of the last minute things to do on my own.","NAH

Plan better so that you both or your husband at the very least can go. You literally have months to do so. 

 All he will be thinking about is his friends wedding the whole weekend anyways or in the ""I really didnt need to be here for this"" head space.

If it cant be done for some oddly specific reason (The Tuxedo guy will only be there that weekend to make his Tux etc.)  then it is what it is but if accommodations can be made i.e You have months ahead to do so, I would go that route","Nah I'm seconding the enlist some help so you can both go (or at least one of you) because while this friend may not be hurt if you can't make it, she'll probably be really touched and happy if you take the time out to go anyway, and thats probably what you fiancé is thinking. Especially if this friend is still planning to make it your wedding. 

Also, I can't tell if you're upset with the friend, but don't be. Not her fault the detail that means so much to her is landing her wedding a week from yours and it sounds like she's not happy about that either.",3,3
b7wxuj,"Female, 30s, US, throwaway. On mobile, please forgive typos, etc. TW: child abuse.

TLDR - AITA for never wanting to go to another out-of-state wedding of my sibling's if they invite my abuser?

INFO: Sibling &amp; I are not super close, but not strained. More like friendly acquaintances, esp since they moved out of state, specifically to the state where our DeadBeat Dad lives. Sibling has a good relationship with DeadBeat. I have no relationship whatsoever with DeadBeat, due to the fact that he physically abused me when I was a toddler.

Mom had left him when pregnant with me, then took him back when I was about two or three years old. He was only with us for a year or so, but he beat and derided me pretty consistently throughout, as well as and verbally abusing our Mom and stealing from us/Mom's friends/our neighbors to support his crack cocaine habit.

Because he abused and traumatized me during early childhood development, I now suffer from clinical major depression &amp; generalized anxiety disorder, with regular anxiety- and panic-attacks. I've developed coping strategies, but a large part of me blames my suffering on DeadBeat. I still have vivid dreams and memories about the times he beat me every once in awhile.

So, Sibling doesn't remember this as they were a fetus/infant at the time. DeadBeat was imprisoned for theft and drugs basically right after they were born. They didn't have contact with him until they were already an adult. They grew up without ever knowing him &amp; always had a very romanticized view of what having him in our lives would be like. So when he offered them financial help for their newborn and a place to stay, they jumped at it. Understandable, I guess.

ISSUE: Sibling's 2nd wedding is coming up. DeadBeat will be there. I thought I was going to be able to handle being near him, esp. as Sibling assures me I don't even have to speak to him or his current wife. However, in these past months leading up to this wedding, my panic attacks &amp; overall anxiety have gotten much more frequent, and I've been struggling more with depressive episodes than I have in recent years. The only major change in my life has been this upcoming wedding. I think it's getting to me more than I initially thought it would. Not to mention that it's out of state, and I'm not in the best financial shape, so there's that added stress.  I also have student loans/debt &amp; I work a non-salaried/non-hourly job - can't really even afford to be going to this one, but I am. None of this is Sibling's fault, and I haven't told them at all.

I'm going to the wedding. I love Sibling and I want to be part of my niblings' lives. But a few weeks after the event, I plan to tell Sibling that this was a one-time-deal. I'm never going to be near DeadBeat ever again if I can help it.

WIBTA for telling them I'm not going to another event/wedding like this? Or should I just not say anything at all unless the situation arises in the future?","NTA. You don't have to be in the same place as your abuser, especially since it seems to be stressing you out so much.

Question, though: does your sibling know about the abuse? If they don't, I feel like telling them might help them understand your reluctance to attend any future events where DeadBeat might be invited.

(Edit: Ok, so they know. I still think you're NTA for not wanting to be in the same space as DeadBeat. Wish you and your sibling all the best.) ","NTA. Surprised you're even going in the first place. I get people can change and I hope your brothers family will be safe there (I have my doubts) but you should not be forced to breath the same air as some child beating coward. 

Your sibling is probably very grateful you are coming. He should also not expect you to attend more events like this with your father present. The wedding is the big one and you are showing a lot of courage to be there for your brother.

Good luck.",0,0

a21qca,"So, a little history is required. I met my ex-wife when I was 19, she was a little older than me and had a three month old. The father had done one when he found out she was pregnant, or so I was told but looking back on everything since I'm not overly sure what's a lie and what isn't. We were together for five years in all and married for one and a half. During this time I raised the little girl as my own and I'm the only father figure she knew and was aware of because she has only recently turned 6 and hadn't met her real dad until the last year.

About a year and a half ago we went through a divorce. We lost a child together through miscarriage and it went downhill from there. She began to not really talk to me about things and seemed to be texting an awful lot. I tried to talk things through because even before the pregnancy we weren't really doing stuff together together. She'd go out with friends and I'd stop in with my step daughter. Then comes the bombshell that she no longer loves me enough and she loves someone else. 10 points to Hufflepuff if you guessed she'd been texting and was getting back with her ex, the one who dumped her pregnant and is my step daughter's biological Dad. I was left with 14K worth of shared debt in my name and having to move back in with my parents, sleeping on the sofa for a year because they didn't have a spare room and I had nowhere to go. 

This brings me to recently. For the last year and a half I have still been seeing my step daughter every fortnight. Maybe an odd choice on my part but I had spent my early twenties raising this girl as my daughter. My ex has been fairly good about that but it's getting obvious I'm making things complex for her new situation and although she won't tell me I can't see my step daughter for fear of looking the bad guy I can tell she wants me to say it. She's lied to her family about our breakup and what she was up to (I found nudes sent and messages about meeting up in a hotel and she did go on a bizarre work trip out of the blue) and whatever she said has made them hate my guts despite the fact I supported a little girl who isn't mine and my ex-wife for five years (with her not working for two of those five).

The frustrating thing is, my stepdaughter's real dad is moving them both to Wales in the new year and we live in the Midlands currently. I'm still in a buttload of debt and visiting my stepdaughter regular would be problematic and they know that. It all came to a head last Sunday as an altercation took place between me and my ex's grandad as I was trying to drop my step daughter back home (until they move to Wales they're living at their grandparents). Basically he's demanding I pay back £1000 he gave me towards my car two and a half years ago which was never a loan. He said it was to help us out because at the time we were in financial trouble without a car and I needed to keep my job which involved a commute. He basically said you do enough for your wife and my stepdaughter and that was that. I said I wasn't comfortable with him giving me money and he just said not to worry. They now claim I said I'd pay it back. I said it was never a question of it being a loan until I got dumped and my ex left me in 14K of debt so am I getting 7K back? Apparently I'm a waste of space, he's taking me to court and went for me as he tried to throw me off his property. All whilst I was trying to say goodbye to my stepdaughter. My ex's grandad has never really liked me, he's bigoted and very opinionated and I was so thankful for their help at the time regardless of the circumstances. But now they keep using my step daughter and access to seeing her as a bargaining chip in their demands. When I said I wouldn't be paying it back as it was never a loan and I'd been left in a mountain of debt he told me never to show my face around the house again and that I was going to be stopped from seeing my stepdaughter as soon as she goes to Wales in February, he let that slip because he was angry and I could see my ex's face drop like he'd let it slip prematurely. She didn't say a word other than to tell me to leave when he started to get aggressive.

I'm honestly not sure what to do. Whether to take this arguement as it and just decide now to walk away, stopping all contact immediately, or keep making the effort until they take my stepdaughter away in Feb. She's miserable because they bitch about me in front of her and start to argue with me in front of her. As much as I love her and I'm sure she'd miss me at first I think she'd be happier out of this toxic nonsense and as difficult as it is to type I think I would too. They've spoilt having her for me because there is always something else and now apparently legal battles and they seem to keep reminding me that she's not mine which is getting more obvious and difficult everytime I see her. Any advice would be appreciated, it's been a tough couple years that just seems to not be ending. The time of year is a big factor, for my own mental and physical health walking away seems the best thing to do but there's a six year old that never asked for any of this looking forward to the holidays and is doing it now cruel? Especially because taking this threat of never showing up again as gospel means I basically just vanish? Is vanishing better than speaking to her? How do you tell a six year old you won't see her again and her not get upset and think it's her fault, especially three weeks before Christmas? 

Despite the fact I was told to never show my face again and that they'd see me in court, my ex text me to say ""sorry bout that, not stopping you seeing xxxxxx"" as if to put the ball in my court and absolve herself from any guilt. I didn't reply and that was about five days ago. If you haven't guessed by this point she's quite manipulative and often finds someway of turning arguments around on me. I have to admit I'm not as eloquent as she is and it's frustrating because she's never proven wrong. I ring my stepdaughter on Sunday evenings by ringing her mum and her passing the phone over, would stopping contact now be the cowards way out? I'm considering blocking their numbers and just moving on. We don't live in the same town anymore but we still work in the same small town, I commute. 

TL; DR Wife left me for my stepdaughter's biological Dad who dumped her pregnant and hadn't seen his daughter in five years. Her family want to take me to court for money I don't owe them and my ex and stepdaughter are planning to move to Wales, not sure whether to walk away now and break all contact and stop being so damn nice (or a push over).",NTA.

dfj0od,"I was diagnosed with MS three years ago, and there have been several incidents involving my older sister (I'll call her B) and my illness.

First, in the family text group 3 years ago, I sent a message confirming my diagnosis (they all knew I was being tested), B's immediate response was ""Since we're all sharing things here, I guess I should let everyone know that I have HPV"".  The conversation immediately turned to B and my mom talking about her HPV. While this was annoying and kind of hurtful that she highjacked the conversation and made it about herself, I know she's like this and my other two sisters just laughed about it, and I ignored it.

Secondly, when I was in town for Thanksgiving 2 years ago (I live out of the country), during dinner she outed me in front of everyone for formerly having an eating disorder. She was drunk, and I genuinely think it was an accident as she often just says things without thinking. But when I tried to talk to her about how she embarrassed me and hurt my feelings, she immediately got really defensive and told me to get over it and that I've done things to hurt her in the past too. I would have gotten over it within a couple days if she had just apologized, but instead I found out that after I flew back to London she had told my mom that it wasn't her fault that I was upset. It was the MS because MS means that I can't control my emotions and that they often aren't real. This is false for so many reasons. Also, she's not a doctor. She roped my mom into this narrative, and my mom believed it for a bit. B still believes this to my knowledge. 

Our relationship has been weird pretty much since then. But there was another incident this year that has made me think it's best that I just completely cut her out of my life. Basically, I have repeatedly told my family how I want to be treated as someone with a serious illness and not to bombard me with articles and blogs about treatments/alternative/homeopathic treatments and to just trust me to be responsible for my treatment and treat me like an adult. Both my mom and B have had issues with this boundary and B is a massage therapist and very into homeopathy and constantly sends debunked garbage, essential oil info, etc that she thinks can help my MS. I got fed up with it and told her off. A month or so passed, and I decided to reach out to her to have a conversation about it and she said she doesn't support me injecting myself with ""man-made synthetics"" aka my medicine (she's very anti-medicine).

The whole situation has been very divisive and upsetting for my whole family, and I don't want them to hurt them, but I don't want her in my life. I know she's family, so AITA for cutting her out?

So my (M25) parents don't really like my fiancé (F23), partly because they are religious Muslims (mom wears hijab) and don't like how she dresses. Now my fiancé doesn't stress immodestly at all by western standards, but very much does by Muslim standards. Neither her or I identify as a Muslims.

So I deliver for a company that could be called DoorTrash.  Anyway, I’m picking up an order at Chain Asian Restaurant That Pretends It’s Authentic.  

Cue Seaweed.  Seaweed is the cute and nice girl who worked the to-go section of CARTPIA.  She explained that one of the items that the DoorTrash customer ordered no longer exists.  I made it clear that I was understanding - honestly, it’s DoorTrash’s mistake for not keeping its menus up to date.  

So Seaweed told me that I was a lot nicer than the other DoorTrash drivers, and I just kind of joked with her about the business.  That’s where I fucked up first.  

There was a little flirting on her part, and some unintentional unspoken attraction cues on my end.  It was refreshing for once that someone was interested in me after saying they liked a character trait instead of directly after meeting me.  

While I texted DT support about the issue, Seaweed called the customer. She then got close to me while phoning the customer, stated her name (it isn’t actually Seaweed), slowly gave the contact phone number, and clearly let it be known that it was her personal number, not the store number.  

Bro, home girl was trying to give me her number.  I’m sure my attraction showed, so why shouldn’t she have the confidence to go for it?

Also, I’m a DoorTrash driver in my late 20’s, so I’m kind of a washout!  Bye, love!!”  

Okay, so it actually gets worse.  

Over the next few days, I had more orders for CARTPIA that I accepted, but then unassigned.  It turns out that restaurants partnered with DoorTrash sometimes have a tablet that shows who is supposed to be picking up the order.  This means that she possibly saw me declining orders to go back to CARTPIA.  I wouldn’t know for sure immediately.  

This is only important because after a few days, I finally had to courage to let myself accept an order for CARTPIA if it came.  So I sat in that busy restaurant complex (it’s a hotspot, so this is normal), but nothing came.  I decided to say “fuck it!” And leave.  So as I’m leaving the parking lot, I look over in the car next to me, and I shit you not, it’s Seaweed.  

This is the reason I feel I’m the asshole.  

Home girl looks up and sees me, turns bright red, and then looks really sad as she hangs her head.  

I know I don’t owe it to someone to get coffee or whatever, but I feel like I led this girl on by not watching my own behavior, not to mention that she would have absolutely no idea why I don’t date anyone.  

Reddit, am I the asshole?  

EDIT:  For everyone saying I should go out with her, DoorTrash isn’t the only reason I can’t date her.  I’m currently living in my car and scared of sex.  While we all have our places, it would be unwise to date someone if your life is a mess.  Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

dsk745,"Girlfriend is a SAHM who lives in a one bedroom, to be frank, shithole. I own my own house so when we began dating and started seeing each other's places, I agreed that she could ""partially live"" in my home. Her legal residence is her apartment, she spends most of her time there, but maybe 2-3 days a week and some nights, she's at my home. Her daughter's (5yo) school is closer to me so it works out for her in that she can pick her kid up, go to my place, wait until I get home, have dinner, then either sleep over or go to their own home. This arrangement has been going on for almost two years.

She's started to leave a mess, and boy is it a mess. I am finding toys everywhere when I get home, food crumbs everywhere, or even whole pieces of food, stuffed in my couches, under my furniture, inside my TV stand, etc. I've been on her case about this for several several months. I am finding (literally) rotten vegetable pieces inside my record player, smooshed in my Playstation, etc.

I get she's a SAHM and it's a full-time job, yada yada blah blah. This doesn't mean you can disrespect other's property like this. She shows zero effort: I often come home to her playing phone games, sitting on my couch, surrounded by a pigsty. I have to stay up late at night just to get everything to working order. At least an hour of cleaning every night they are over.

I decided the root of the problem is the messy kid so I've banned her from my home. Previous to this I've ""banned"" toys and food from my living room which fell on deaf ears. If my girlfriend wants to come over, she needs to come alone. It's not a right to visit my place, it's a privilege.

dbr2qt,"Quotations are for me assuming the wrong gender

Background is that I work on a military base, and most people, even those that don't smoke, hang out in the smoke pit when things get slow. This particular day, there was no flying, so there's a large group of people there. The person in question is a pretty skinny ""guy"" and has hair a little longer than the military allows for men, but we all work flight line maintenance so not having time to get a haircut is somewhat normal, even though it's still cause for discipline.

We're all hanging out, when I see one of the Airmen that noone really talks to sit a table away from us. I'm pretty inclusive and somewhat outgoing, so in a bid to invite ""him"" over, I say ""Hey man, what's up?"" 

""I'm not a man.""

I'm instantly confused, but after a few seconds, I realize what's going on. I go to apologize, but what comes out is ""My bad, man."" 

Before I can recant my previous statement, she gets up and leaves. I feel pretty bad about it, but don't know her well enough to follow and apologize, so I leave it alone. 

Today, I see her supervisor and she tells me how upset she was, even asking if I can lose my job for this, although I think it was an honest mistake.

bh5rz9,"For context: my parents and I (F25) are South American, and we moved to Europe when I was a young teenager. I think this is important since it has caused us to have different mindsets (they’re very traditional and family oriented, I have, generally speaking, very different values and ideals). I’m also an only child.

I still live with my parents, it’s relatively normal in my country not to move out until you have a stable job. I finished my engineering degree last year and have been working an actual job (not the greatest income but it’s fine as my first job) for almost 6 months now. I decided around January that this would be the year I’d finally become independent and move out. 

We are middle class and my parents are paying rent for our apartment, so as soon as I started working they asked me to help financially, which I agreed with. I don’t help them with the rent, but I do help with the rest of the expenses and pay for my own food. They’re very insistent with me helping out even though we are not that scarce on money (my mom doesn’t need to work) but I still help whenever i can. 

I’m almost financially independent except for the rent. We have talked about us splitting the rent, but the thing is - I’ve been trying to save up and cut on some personal expenses to actually pay rent somewhere else (they ask for huge initial deposits so I do need to save up a lot). I don’t like where I live: it’s too faraway from the centre, very quiet and suburban, and I’m very excited with the idea of moving somewhere closer to where I work and go out with friends, near the heart of the city where there’s more life and younger people as well. 

Me bringing this up has caused endless fights and even if I try to stay calm and not get heated, they always end up calling me selfish for wanting to get separated from them, for not making them my priority, and for putting myself first since family is always the most important. 

On top of that, my father got offered a job in another city and now they NEED me to stay at this apartment to pay for half the rent, since my dad will be renting another apartment near his new job and he can’t be paying for two apartments without my help. I suggested we get rid of this apartment and for my mom to move with him, but they don’t want that. They want to keep this apartment for at least a year, and for that they need me to help with the rent.

I let it slip that they just want to keep me “trapped” here (cuz I’d still be living with my mom, she doesn’t want to leave our city and wants to stay with me) and basically all hell broke loose. They kept calling me selfish, that my money should go to them, that all children should strive to make their parents lives easier, not to “flee” like I’m trying to.

I’m starting to believe I’m actually being a selfish daughter. I really don’t know what to do or what to think..

ep88yt,"This is something that happened quite a few years ago, but I sometimes still feel guilty about it, so I want some outside opinions.

I agreed to work as a nanny for a couple who had three kids (2, 2, and 1). When I first met with them we discussed payment and I agreed to take a lower hourly rate than I would normally accept ($9/hr - which was lower than the minimum wage in my state at the time) because they were a young couple and I could tell they were struggling to get by. The mom also worked from home, and if I needed help or anything, she would be willing to take a break from work, which is another reason such a low payment for 3 children was agreed on.

I worked for them for about a year and I felt like a part of the family. The kids were super sweet and the parents were so enjoyable to talk to. They repeatedly told me they really appreciated me and loved me being their nanny.

Then one day, the mom tells me she's pregnant, and she seemed happy and I was happy for her, but I could tell it would be a financial stress since they were already struggling. Less than a week later, she fired me for not handling a situation where a child got injured the way she wanted me to. The one year old fell and hit his head on the wall. I comforted him but he was screaming so mom came out to check what was going on. She took him and I continued watching the two year olds while she held him. She told me that she was going to take him to the ER and I needed to go home. I was a little confused why she thought that was necessary (he had a bump on his head, but he was acting his usual self and was back to playing after a little while) but I understand some people are more protective of their children. She then called me the next day and said they took him to the ER and he was fine, but that I handled the situation badly so her and her husband decided to let me go. I was really shocked because the mom really handled most of the situation, so I'm not sure what she expected me to do? Call 911?

I was really surprised to get fired just like that since I was so close to the family, but i had my suspicions it was because they couldn't afford to pay me anymore now that they had another child on the way.

Fast forward a few months, and the mom contacts me and asks me for my social security number so that they can file babysitting as part of their taxes. I was really confused because they had never mentioned in the past year of working for them that they planned on doing this. Maybe I'm TA for assuming it would be under the table but that's the norm (in the US), and they were already paying me less than minimum wage to watch three(!) children, but I don't think they originally planned to file. I think they did it because they were desperate for money. I blocked her and her husband and didn't give them any information.

I'm (16M) originally African, but I was born and lived in England my whole life. My parents (late 40s) have moved here way before I was born and lived here longer than they have in Africa, so that makes my family of 4 British.

Last summer, we went there as a holiday and to also meet our extended family for the first time. They knew we were coming to visit and preserved a house for us to rent 6 months beforehand (yeah the hotels were trashy there, we were told). It was pretty sweet and quite emotional, actually. My parents hadn't seen my grandparents for more than 20 years and my sister (14F) and I met them for the first time.

Here's the problem. Whenever I would talk to my sister about anything or whenever she would talk to me about anything, a few of my uncles and aunts (they don't know English) would ALWAYS tell us ""stop speaking English and start speaking your native tongue, are you white?"" or they would just butt in mid-conversation and demand to know what we are discussing.

It was extremely pisstaking for two reasons: I can't talk my mother tongue very well and how stupid and unreasonable their remarks were. I told my parents already and they told them to cut it out but they laugh it off and say it's a joke. Every. Single. Damn. Time.

This continued and even went to the extent that one time I was on the phone with my friends back in London to catch up, and I could slightly hear them laughing and mimicking me.

It happened again one day on another one of my daily phone calls home, and one of my maternal uncles (yes, he was part of the mimicking game too) said ""you're in (country) now, why aren't you talking (language)?""

I ignored it and didn't bat an eyelid. He left and came back afterwards, this time tapping my shoulder softly and was forcing my attention. I told my friends ""I got to go now, bye"" and hung up. Immediately, I fought stupid with stupid and asked ""how about you start speaking English for once?"". He was shocked and was about to say something but I said ""of course you can't, and neither can I speak (language), so piss off."" in the pretty harsh tone.

My mum found out and was pretty angry at how disrespectful I was. I said ""I love my uncles and aunts, but I can't respect them if they don't respect me"". She had no words but was a little upset at how bitter our relationship got, and so was my dad. My sister thought I was right. I told my friends and most of them are like me so they can relate to my situation. What about you guys? Was I right or wrong?

Then the other friends and myself were to reimburse him.  It was a 4 bedroom house.   A week before our conference my friend texts me specifics.  He says “the total cost was $1280 and there will be 4 people, therefore $320 per person.”  I said great I will have cash upon arriving.  Upon arriving (I was the last one to get there) there were four people there already and I was the fifth.  Three people had their own rooms and the fourth person was in a room with a bunk bed.  I was directed to join the person in the room with the bunk bed.  The bunk bed turned out to be too small and awkward (I’m tall) so I ended up sleeping on the couch.

He said he wanted the full $320.  He explained that the fifth person was to be ‘comped.’  In other words the other four should pay for the fifth persons share.

(U1+2 = Uncles)

When my parents divorced I (5) moved in with grandparents. I would visit parents until I came home from seeing my dad with a mark across my face; my grandad told both my parents that he would be raising me from that point onwards. When is was 19 he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. I became his carer whilst U1/2 rarely visited.

In November he was admitted to hospital.  I spent from 6 to 11 with him every day. During his hospital stay U1 would show up once a week, and spend the time FaceTiming his girlfriend. U2 would visit fortnightly for 10 minutes.

On Christmas Eve he took a turn for the worse and I rang all members of the family to let them know. Christmas morning was full of family member he hadn’t seen regularly or at all in years. I skipped the offers of Christmas dinner and stayed with him until he passed.

U1 and U2 were keen to be involved with legal aspects. It was decided that I would pay everything and U1 and U2 would refund me when it was totalled up (they had the most disposable income/savings and it would be returned from the estate). So I paid funeral costs, outstanding balances for bills/credit cards etc which wiped all my savings and some essential money. In total this was close to £28K. U1 and U2 had been going to the house daily and thrown away all his belongings unless they deemed them valuable in which case they sold/kept them. U1 and U2 have also removed the kitchen, carpets and most of the bathroom saying they would pay for the place to be redecorated.

At this point we went to his solicitors to make sure we hadn’t missed anything. Surprise to everyone my grandad had made a new will a year prior to being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s with myself as the sole beneficiary, and a note with his reasoning being that all of his children are middle aged, own their own homes and have adult children.

Once finding out that they don’t benefit from the will they have left the house in a complete state of disrepair, refused to refund me any money unless I agree to completely disclaim the will and any inheritance, and use the older will with his five children being the beneficiaries. 

This has left me in the position of not being able to pay my rent and living off rice. The house is unsellable and I have no funds to repair it, and further solicitors bills to pay.

bhtott,"Twice now, when leaving a parking lot, I've chosen a route that is slightly longer because I want to avoid a busy intersection and a specific left turn. Both times, my wife has gotten irritated and wanted to argue about the fact that the route I chose is longer and depending on the way you hit the lights could take longer. I believe that since I'm driving I should be able to take the route I want, even if it is slightly longer and it's not a big deal. Both times I took this route, we've gotten in a fight.

Our argument today devolved in to a discussion about other things we do that annoy each other, but for the purposes of this thread, I just want to know if I'm being an asshole for not going the route that she would prefer. Maybe I'm not seeing this clearly and objectively.

As an illustration, I've marked the route she would like in pink and the route I took in blue.

If someone gets invited to something and the invitation is only for them, they should ask the host if it's OK to bring someone else along beforehand.

This is stupid. I know this is stupid. But.

I made a Facebook post that was very 'on brand' for me, both in terms of content and language. It said, and I quote: ""Lemme get a haiku about what's going on in your life"" following by a downward pointing emoji. It ended up being a relatively successful thread (for me) with about 50 comments. 2 days later, a Facebook friend (but only real life acquaintance) posted the exact same thing, verbatim.

a5jjbd," 

Little background, I'm a 5th year senior who's graduating in December 20th (so like eight days). Me and three other fraternity brothers were taking a course together. This course was notified early on that there would be a group project worth 65% of our grade and that we should pick 1 - 2 partners accordingly. I asked one of brothers who I will call M to join my group since I know he's a smart person and we were friends. He agreed to be my partner and I thought that was the end of that. The project gets released a month later and it turns out M asked another fraternity brother to join our group and now it's a three person project. The projects difficulty scales according to how many people are in each group. I was surprised but he assured me it was no big deal and that we would be fine. Fast forward to a week before the deadline and zero progress had been made by the other two partners and I had done a fair amount of the starting work. Decided to hit them up and tell them we need to finish it as it's a large chunk of our grade. We meet up lets say on a monday and nothing was really done so I decided to go home and complete it on my own. I didn't end up completing it but luckily it got extended by three days. Great, I hit up my partners again and they both claimed they'd work on it again.... nothing had been done. The last day i'm scrambling to get even a 40% of the marks, but i did not finish. I e-mailed my professor after he had graded it (as i got a 20/100 originally). He emails all three of us to come to his office hours and to present the project, we all agreed today to go. But yet again the same theme, I'm the only one who went. I cannot possibly pass with a grade under a sixty ( The weight of the project is way too big), and I fail I would have to take another semester, pay thousands of dollars, and retake the course so I decided to tell him that I did the majority on my own and that I wanted it to be graded as a single person project instead of a three person. He ended up settling on giving me an eighty instead of a forty five.

TLDR: Did entire project on my own, screwed over friends to save my grade and to graduate on time.

This happened earlier today and these guys are my friends (though not really that close). I feel really guilty but I did what I had to do in my opinion, my other two friends contributed nothing significant at all. They are younger and can retake the course without having to extend their educating. But I still feel guilty, I want to hear your opinions. AMTI?","NTA

djr9t5,"For context, I live in a 2-bedroom apartment (that my roommate's parents own) with my roommate who is a friend of mine from college. We are allotted two spots in a parking garage and a single placard for street parking. The spots in the garage are aligned vertically so if we are both parked inside, the car in front will be blocked by the car behind. This became a bit of hassle so I agreed to take the street placard and park my car on the street so we aren't constantly needing to move out of each other's way.

Fast forward 1 year, I received a promotion at work which provided me with a company vehicle so I now have 2 cars.  I parked my old car in the front spot of the garage as I won't be driving it often and continue to park my everyday car on the street with the placard. This has now become an issue for my roommate because his gf has nowhere to park when she comes over and there is extremely limited unrestricted street parking. My gf also deals with the same issue.

A few days ago my  roommate asked me if I could leave my old car in an unrestricted spot on the street to free up a space for his gf. I told him I would prefer to leave it in the garage since I don't drive it often and it's better for the car to remain inside.  There was quite a bit of back and forth and my roommate's argument was that since his parents own the apartment and are giving us a deal on rent (I pay about half of what the previous tenants were charged), he should be the one with preferential access to parking.

The conversation ended with him going to consider how much extra to charge me per month for using an extra spot which I think I will also refuse. AITA?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Not that it makes much difference but there is a 24hr lot across the street that my gf parks at when she or any other guests come over. For reasons unknown his gf does not like parking there. I will pay the extra amount for the spot, I appreciate the feedback!",YTA. You are using two spots out of a total three.

cv0quv,"Just for starters I really love my baby brother but I grew sick of looking after him every week. This began in the half of my summer break.  My mother works late every day and his dad came home in the afternoons. So as expected I took care of him most of the time. I enjoyed spending time with him and trying to teach him to talk. He also adores me very much that he comes looking for me during the nights in my room. 

However, his father has the end of the weeks off so I expect him to take care of him. But he always puts him off me by being on his phone all the damn time or going to the gym for an hour. He always asks me if I fed him or changed him which reallys gets me pissed off. In the end I'd endure it and took care of my brother again. The only times I have the days off are sundays afternoons when his dad takes his son to go outside. 

Anyways school started this week and it's finally the weekend. I try to start my comic I've always wanted to draw before i got interrupted by my baby brother. I played his cartoon on my laptop so I could start drawing before his dad comes out of the room and tells me he's gonna move the truck. He doesn't come back after an hour or so to eat. Then he tells me he'll be back and leaves. He came back after three hours and I had to take care of my brother during the times he was gone which got me really angry and stressed

My sister's boyfriend came into the room and told me it was sick what his dad and my mom were doing and i should face them so I did. When they both came home I angrily told them I was sick taking care of my brother when it was his dad's days off and the only time I'd be willing to take care of him is when he's not here. I also told him he's not acting like a dad. They both looked pretty angry after I told them.

 I stormed off and heard my mom whispering to my stepdad how he should lock himself in his room with my baby brother so I could stop complaining about how he takes care of him. That statement made me breakdown.

Important note is that she didn’t have to come over: she has a very nice place to live, and her family life is fine.

On the way out, we passed the museum store. She asked for a stuffed animal in the window and I explained to her that I’d told her multiple times all day that if her behavior didn’t improve, she wouldn’t get a toy. Her parents said I have no chill and should know five year olds have attitude.

My mom then asked me if I could make a picture for her for her birthday. Naturally I said yes, but it would be smaller because I'm not spending money on such a big frame again. Plus I have over a month to make it. But not even a week or two after I said yes, my mom has kept pestering me about it. Asking about when I'll start working on it and how excited she is.

On top of that, I do want to start getting paid for my work.

I didn't really think anything of it, but then a few weeks ago I woke up from a nap and he wasn't home. I went to his room to see if his bag was gone (we've been friends for 10 years and are quite open around each other, so he doesn't mind me going into his room and whatnot) and his bag was gone but his phone was on the bed.

Which he thought was ""super funny""

After, when we had a staff debriefing about it, I said something like ""I know he's autistic, but he attacks people just because he doesnt like them, that makes him an asshole""

ETA: I made this  comment  rjght after they said they would not be taking the kid to an er to see if he warranted a psych admit because that ""would be too traumatizing due to his autism""

Now several of my coworkers are upset with me for saying that and think Im an asshole for saying it. (As I was saying earlier Ive worked here for years and love these kids and am usually very understanding when I or someone else gets attacked)

So AITA?

ETA 2: This debrief was probs 15 minutes after it happened, so I was def  still pretty amped up and had spent those 15 mins consoling the terrified children in my class who saw it

e0aqhw,"I’m a grad student and have been attending school (both undergrad and grad) far from home for about six years now. I don’t get to visit home very often because cross-country airfare is expensive and I cannot afford it.

Every time I visit, I wind up frustrated with my family because they will not take an hour to come get me from the airport. The shuttle that goes from the airport to my suburb is incredibly slow, often delayed hours (so I wind up standing at the airport for hours after nine hours of preceding travel), and makes me car sick. The last three times I’ve gotten out of it, I’ve immediately thrown up from the nausea. 

For context, I have picked my dad up from the airport every time he has visited me at school. My father finds layovers annoying (much the same way I find the shuttle annoying, though with less vomiting), so he will only take the one direct flight from my hometown toward my school that the closest airport offers. That flight comes in at 4:30 AM and necessitates that I get up at 3:00 AM and drive an hour and a half to get him. There is a train station a half mile from the airport that would literally drop him at my doorstep, but he refuses to learn how to use Uber to get there or take a shuttle to the train. He is in good health and engages in intense exercise; it isn’t a matter of mobility challenges. 

When I mentioned that this set-up seemed unfair and that it hurt my feelings that my family members couldn’t take an hour of their time to come get me once a year, my father told me I was being spoiled. Of course I am not entitled to being picked up, but I don’t think I’m unreasonable for pointing out the disparity.

For further context, this pick-up situation has applied even when: several family members were free/not working, my dad was getting off work (he works ten minutes from the airport), and when I was being flown home due to severe medical complication. The usual explanation is a disdain for airport traffic.","Skip the visits. They obviously don't care if you're there or not.

NTA","NTA. I'm sorry your parents are making you do it all on your own, it's not ok and not fair to you. Unless you personally benefit from the visits I'd suggest foregoing them for a bit.

Keep being you and picking up family when they come - because it's the right fucking thing to do, and don't stoop to their level of selfishness or act like they would. Good luck.",0,0
dm590h,"This was a few years ago when I was in the military , and in charge of my unit's budget to an extent. I had to meet with our company treasurer (the wife of another soldier) to arrange details of an upcoming family day event. I suggested a lunch meeting off base at a local restaurant where I hadn't been before. She didn't have day care for her infant so I suggested that my wife and daughter could also accompany us (her husband was already expected to attend). The food was not amazing, but for sushi in Kansas it was resonable for the price. The main problem I had was thar the server was very rude. She had the 'what you want' attitude you would expect from a McDonald's, would set drinks and food down harshly enough to spill without any sort of apology. After enduring her attitude I was hardly willing to tip 10% depending on how many frivolous refills or other erroneous charges were added. But when I finally got the bill the server had hand written a 25% gratuity onto the roughly 150 dollars tab. I was quite upset and went into what i would consider 'full Karen mode' and demanded to know why this was added. The waitress pointed out that clearly printed on the back of the menu it said parties of 6 or more will be charged 25%mandatory gratuity. 
Let me recap my ""party"" for you, my wife and I,  another soldier and his wife, and 2 infant children. I would  understand if they were toddlers that I actually order food for, or even if they didn't get food from but still managed to make a mess. But my  infant daughter stayed in the car seat and slept the entire time. their's fussed, not even cried, for about 30 seconds until a bottle was provided. Clearly I'm not an asshole for believing two infants shouldn't be considered as party members (especially as practically the only dinners at 1:00 on a Tuesday) however i do call my handling of the situation for judgement.
So after heated debate with our waitress, who claimed to be an owner now(I never verified, so WE) I was unable to do anything other than cross through the amount she had written and replace them with zeros. This wasn't enough for me so i called my bank and explained the situation in hopes they could stop any further charges from the restaurant. They told me that in order to dispute anything I would have to claim the entire transaction was fraudulent, to which I agreed. After about a week I was notified that the entire transaction was refunded permanently.  IDK if there are any repercussions from a bank declaring you committed a fraudulent charge but i know that this event led to that restaurant being placed on a warning list distributed to the entire base. Possibly this could have severely effected their business.","It’s technically not a fraudulent charge, you gave her your card and paid for the meal, soooooooooo, you legit lied to the bank YTA",NTA.

In that time my friend calls, text, FaceTime, dm's, does every version of contacting me he can. Granted this doesn't bother me too much, but hearing my phone vibrate a million times and having to turn it off everytime for something I was just finishing up and would take 0 time at all if I wasn't interrupted really boils my blood.

aglnsi,"I dated this girl December last year until October this year, I really got to love her and I am not sure if I still love her, even after we broke I still supported about her supposed rape. Long story short, she got raped at 14 in Mexico by her cousin, she and I live in the US, the reasons why I doubt it is because.

1. She said everyone in her family knows, but they still gather to hang out like if nothing happened.
2. Her cousin family still comes to visit with the guy that raped her, again, like if it is normal.
3. On their last visit this December she said that she woke up with her pants down, if I was the rapist father, I wouldn't let them sleep in the same house.
4. When that thing happened in December she told me that the other guy that raped her was there too, another cousin, so I just found out that was not one, but two.

I have never been in a situation like this, that is why I am suspicious about all this, because I really find it stupid that no one in her family cares and see it like if nothing happened.

Thanks for your attention.

Edit: So her Bday is tomorrow and since she has problems at school I texted her just saying, ""Hey, how is school going?"" which she replied, ""why do you care"".

Then she added me in a group chat with her bf because she said she was getting mad, and this guy is just treating me about if I keep talking to her or her friends he will come to find me, which I told him that we can meet if he wants to, but he just kept saying that he was going to beat me up but never wanted to meet.

He said. ""She already blocked you, why are you still texting her"", which is not true, she never blocked me, that's why I was still able to text her.

The guy told me that she thinks I am weird, (probably because i told her that even when he and I have the same age, he has a son that needs to take care of and not looking for girls in a weird app) So I blocked her, I didn't want to, but she seemed really stressed, and I didn't want to give her more troubles with his bf, I also think he should't have told her to make a group chat, that would stress her more.

Anyway, since you all were so helpful, I wanted to update this.

Thanks again.

EDIT 2: This is still very helpful, I am still trying to deal with this, break, a girl I know that was raped, his stupid boyfriend and family. A lot of you are right, this is not part of me anymore and I might look like a stalker, but this just happened this Monday, I still talk just to one of her friends and she told me that she wanted to keep in touch with me instead that something bad happened to her (my ex friend wants to keep in touch with me) because she also knows what a fuck she is (my ex). I thank you all, idk if I really wanna forget her, but I know is a long process.

Thanks!","YTA for sure. It sounds like you don’t believe people actually get raped. Also sounds like you’re assuming other people think the way you do (especially about the rapist’s dad’s decision making). I don’t see any credible reason for you to think she is lying. She may be lying, but you’re an asshole for assuming she is without a good reason other than the fact that it’s too hard for you to imagine rapists exist.

e00094,"I worked in a tight knit pharmacy for a big Midwest chain store for 3 years. I got along with everyone. People actually liked working with me for some reason. For my last year there I had to cut back to part time because I was finishing my masters. My last day of work was a Saturday and I had been telling everyone 'this is my last month', 'this is my last week', 'last time I'll see our weekly stats'. So that Saturday comes around I show up to work as usual and it's just another day. The openers go to leave, see you tomorrow, and I say 'nope, last day I'll see you never.' They all just kind of stare at me; bewildered. 'I didn't know that', 'When did this happen?'. Even the pharmacist didn't know. The rest of that day I was so depressed I hid in the bathroom every half hour because I was in tears. I waited until the end of the day to 'pass judgement' and no one came around to say goodbye. There wasn't even a card. When I got home I decided that I wouldn't talk to them after that because they made it clear that I wasn't even significant enough to remember to put together a goodbye card.

A week after that the head pharmacist asked me to come in because they wanted to give me something. I straight up told her that pharmacy makes me feel sick because they all forgot about me and my last day and I didn't want to go back for anything.

To add to this, there's a total of 10 people that work there. Everytime an employee passed through, even the interns that were there for a week, they at least put together a card. So I personally felt insulted when one of the pharmacists who's there full-time forgot about my last day.

EDIT: to be clear, what the pharmacist wanted to give me was the copy of my license they kept on the wall, not a gift.

EDIT: Jesus I didn't think people would care at all. Let me clarify some things: we regularly hung out after work before I went for my masters. They regularly said I was a close friend outside of work. I worked my ass off every minute I was there. And I get it, me crying in the stalls is childish, but I felt heartbroken for being forgotten after three years. I couldn't help it. They just happened. But I kept hiding because I didn't want to cry in front of customers or my coworkers. And again, there was never a gift, they just wanted to give me a copy of my license that they had. I reduced my hours over the course of a year. My expectation for my last day was a farewell. No party, no potluck. 

I apologized to my pharmacist today and she apologized for forgetting about it. All the full timers were at a weekend party and forgot.",[deleted],YTA... get over yourself... seriously... this is super ridiculous.,0,3

59jmqk,"**TL;DR I want to dye my hair some crazy colors. My boyfriend hates unnatural hair colors and while he says he'll love me regardless he thinks it looks trashy and he is gonna be bummed out if I dye it. I think I'm gonna do it anyway. Am I an asshole?**

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year and a half now. He's loving, caring blah blah blah. We have a great relationship with some minor conflict, but everything has been getting better (he grew up in a shitty household and this is his first real long term relationship, so he's kinda learning how a healthy relationship works). He's 25 and I'm 21.

When I go through periods of stress I usually get myself a big ""gift"", usually something that is a big change. I'm in college so generally this is once a semester. Last semester I got a cat, the semester before that I got a pet snake, the one before that I went platinum blonde and the one before that I dyed my hair red. For some reason it helps me cope with stress. 

So it's getting to that time again and I figured my ""gift"" this semester would be dying my hair some crazy colors. I've always wanted to do that and I feel like if I do it I need to do it soon since I probably won't be able to after graduation because I'll have a job (or at least be seeking one). I've been floating the idea past my boyfriend for a few months but yesterday I asked him in earnest to tell me what he thought. I sent a few pictures of styles I liked for his opinion and he confessed that he hated unnatural hair dyes, thought they looked trashy and that he really couldn't see himself liking any hair dye on me because he likes my natural color. 

I even tried photoshopping some different hair colors on a picture of me to see if that would change his mind (and because it was fun) but he still hated it. He told me I could do what I want, that he would still love me but that he prefers my natural hair and mentioned that if I had an appearance preference for him, he would do it. He told me he would still support me regardless and that it's my body to do what I want with, he was just gonna hate the way it looked.

Initially I figured I would just not dye it and that would be that, but I'm having a really hard time giving up on the idea and I feel like I'll regret it later if I don't go a little crazy now while I have the chance. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna just do it anyway but I feel shitty. I know if he wanted to do something like buzz his hair that I wouldn't like I'd be kinda disappointed too, I don't blame him at all for that. But does doing it anyway make me an asshole?","In short, no. 

If you're going through a stressful time and you think it will help you then go for it. Yes, he might not like dyed hair too much and even thinks it looks trashy, but he seems like he still very much supports your decision to do it regardless.

You're only young once, I say go for it! It's just hair, you can always change it.
","You're not the asshole. You can be in any sort of committed relationship and absolutely at no point should your partner be able to tell you what you can and cannot do. He can express his opinion, but you, as an adult woman with autonomy/control of your body, have the final say. 

He doesn't have to like your hair color to still love you. If he can't deal with it, it shows you now some glaring problems that likely would have come up later in the relationship. But overall, it's just hair that'll grow out and get re-dyed in no time anyway.

egyr4u,"This has been an ongoing thing between my mother and I for years but it has been becoming increasingly frustrating, and today I got upset and confronted her. 

My mom has a habit of making plans for me and speaking for me when I'm not present, or just doesn't take my schedule into consideration. Some examples (I'll try to keep it brief):

Mom has a potluck at work and wants to make something to bring. Tells me the night before that she needs to go out to get ingredients.

Tells Dad that she and I are going to get ingredients for our bbq dinner and that we'll ""take care of it"". 

Has a baby shower to attend to and planned to make a diy gift and needs to go to the craft store (again, tells me that night before).

Pets (2 kitties) needs to go to the vet for flea medication and checkup. Tells Dad that I'm free and I'm going to do it. 


The list goes on. For context, my father and I are the only ones that can drive and has a car in the family. Whatever the scenario is, I (that one that's driving) am the last person to know about these plans my mom makes. I work full time and go to school full time while trying to keep up with my studies and attempt to maintain a social life with friends and family during my free time. I feel like I'm always put in an uncomfortable position where I'm forced to cancel social plans, or I can't go with my mom's plans because I have work or school.

The last couple of occurrences, I've been telling her that I wish that she would've asked me earlier so I can accommodate and put a day aside to help her do whatever she needs to do. Her reply was, ""It's fine, you're busy so I just won't do the things I was going to do. That's all"". I don't think she understands that if she communicates with me better and earlier, she would be able to go through with her plans successfully. 

Well, today I just had enough as she told my dad that I'm free (I had plans to meet with some friends that I haven't seen in a long time, and won't be able to see after this week because of college) and that she and I will be preparing dinner tonight. I got upset and asked her why she didn't confirm my plans with me first. She started getting upset saying ""You weren't doing anything today so is it so wrong for me to assume that you're free tonight?"". So I said ""Yeah it's wrong, you don't need to assume if I'm free or busy, you can just ask me, then make plans on what to do tonight"". We argue our points and my dad steps in and says I'm being unreasonable and wrong, and it's ""not that big of a deal"". Now they're both pissed at me and left to have dinner out instead of at home.

bzk4jc,"So I was at a fundraiser a couple weeks ago.  They had a raffle where you buy tickets and can choose put them in different pots for drawing for different prizes.  The fundraiser was for a good cause, so I didn't mind buying lots of raffle tickets and putting them in the pots of different prizes.

So during the event they started drawing the winning tickets.  I won a mediocre prize  right off.  (Not surprising.  I had bought a lot of tickets).  Later in the evening my ticket got drawn for another, better prize.   The person in charge said ""oh, he already won, let's give someone else a chance."" Then threw my ticket out and drew somebody else's name.  I didn't do, or say anything at the time, but I did quietly get angry.  I mean I had spent more on tickets, so why is it a problem if I won more prizes.  There were no rules in place limiting the number of prizes you could get.  At the very least I wouldn't have minded keeping the second, better prize and giving the first, mediocre prize back.

","This seems like a situation where a lot more background info is probably needed, but based off this alone youre definitely not an asshole.

You are allowed to have friends, she's allowed to have friends. Friends hang out.

I think her boyfriend's frustration is unwarranted, misdirected and, in a sense, shouldn't be happening. But I also think we can understand why he might be slightly bothered by a dude that he doesn't know asking to hang out with his girlfriend. I don't think that makes him protective or overbearing or possessive, it's just an odd situation. Him calling you up was unacceptable though and crossed into that protective/possessive territory, there are better ways.

I've made it a habit of involving my friends' significant others as often as I can when I want to hang out with someone, whether it's a man or woman. I like being supportive of good, healthy relationships and hanging out with the couple as a couple is one way of seeing if it's good and healthy. Plus, I don't like putting someone in a position of having to ask ""is my SO invited?"" Of course I want them along! This also makes it completely clear to all parties that there are no other motives.

be54zb,"I met my best friend in high school. She had this boyfriend who was bad for her and she never saw it. They were on and off for a few years. After we graduated, she moved in with him.

She was 5 months pregnant at the time. She told me I was an awful person for pressing charges Bc she was pregnant and trying to get ready for a baby. And that we could have “worked it out.” I don’t feel like I was in the wrong there. We are no longer friends and don’t talk. WITAH?","NTA

aejsfo,"So me and my ex-girlfriend were together for nearly ten years (met when we were in school). A year ago found out that she had been cheating on me throughout the entire relationship with other guys. I was massively affected by it and went on downwards spiral of depression and my confidence was basically destroyed. I was like this for about 6 months, then met this wonderful girl who bought me back to a normal state. Six months into this relationship and ex found about us and decided to send me her nudes and captioned it saying ‘Here are the photos you asked me for’. I instantly told my girlfriend this and she thankful believed me ( ex has in the past asked to get together with me) that it was false and her intention was to break us apart.

Few days later, I was at a mutual friend party and my ex was there and I decided to send the photos to two of my close friends at the party and basically made fun of the photo. No one else apart from the three of us saw it. We didn’t make fun of her directly but it was obvious that it was aimed that her.

When my girlfriend found about it, she was angry(?) with me. In my mind what I did was justified, as my ex deserved it for trying to break us apart.","YTA.

c4v24t," 

Hello,  i'm 14. where i live, Denmark, right now most are going to the priest to prepare  for confirmation. This is basically confirming the decision your parents  made when they had you baptized.

many  of my classmates are being confirmed. It is worth mentioning that with  being confirmed comes a big party. It is also the societal norm to be  confirmed. Therefore there is, in my opinion, a sense of pressure to be  confirmed.

i will not be confirmed.  However i do go to priest. They way it is described to me is not so much  a bible study but more an ethical discussion about life, death etc. I  believe that there is problems with what you have to state when you are  confirmed. Among-st other more complicated and philosophical issues, you  have to state, albeit indirectly, that god created earth. I know that  many of the people who are getting confirmed do not believe this, some  of them have said so.

I think that it  is bad and scary that an institution has so much clout that it can get  people to swear on things they actually don't believe in. Also i enjoy  debating which is why i usually confront (lack of a better word) those  who are to be confirmed.

Usually when it comes up in conversation like ""oh which priest do you have?"" or "" have you bought your suit/dress yet?"" etc.

i  will say something like "" you're being confirmed ?"" to which they  answer ""yes"". I will then follow up with something like "" so do you  believe in god"" To be honest I've never really gotten further than this  as people usually avoid the question or get the message and say  something like"" you can't talk me out of being confirmed.

I've come up with a few arguments for and against me being the asshole so you can sense the debate going on within me:

i am the asshole:

maybe they don't believe in god and shouldn't actually be confirmed. But who are you to tell them how to live their life.

they  didn't ask for this and perhaps they aren't prepared for this debate.  You're the asshole for having a debate they never asked for.

i'm not the asshole:

The point of confirmation is to debate and think about what you believe in. So they should be open to talk about these things.

it  is terrible that a organization has this much clout and you should  confront them because they're are a part of the problem because they  blindly say yes to something just because it is expected and maybe  because they like the idea of having a party and drinking for the first  time ( confirmation symbolizes the jump into adulthood, so many parents  allow they're children to drink for the first time here )

if you've read this whole post i am truly thankful.  Am i the asshole?","YTA, unless someone wants to get into an intense religious debate it’s a jerk move to just start one.  You’re being a drama queen.","YTA but god bless you for it (pun intended)

People hate being called out on their hypocrisy. Yet, this is a necessary role that someone has to fill, because otherwise, everyone would go around believing their own bullshit.

What you are doing is good, but do not be under any illusion that anyone will ever thank you for it.

Please, keep on showing people just how much their bullshit stinks. Point out how this antiquated institution that they don't trust or believe in has them shitting their pants and jumping through hoops.

If you really want to rub it in, through a party for yourself anyway... for not being confirmed, but for standing up to your values.",1,2
dkyd1o,"My fiance and I got engaged in March last year and started planning the wedding a month later. Neither of us have huge lists of extended friends/family and we didn't like any of the venues around our town so we decided to have a destination wedding. This was something we consulted many people on, as we're aware of the stigma associated with destination weddings - that they're exclusionary in particular. We had a few people tell us they wouldn't be able to make it if that's what we wanted to do but about 80% of people said they could/would, so we started booking things and making arrangements.

Fast forward to now, when flights are now coming out and the RSVP date is next month (wedding is in October 2020). I've been following up on people just to make sure the ones who initially agreed and said they'd come are still willing/able to. To my surprise, most of the people on my side are now saying they can't. Some I believe are for genuine reasons (ie- buying a house, changing careers, pregnant) and then there are the not so genuine reasons of just not feeling like it anymore. From the start I've tried to be understanding and as inclusive as possible, and when these people told me they were no longer coming I was polite and said I understood, no hard feelings, etc.

It didn't actually start to bother me until I realised my fiance's tally for her side of friends/family and pretty much all of them who said they'd come are still coming. Moreover, she ended up inviting a few extra people, and some of her family members are asking us if other extended family (people we've only met like twice ever) can come because they are really keen to. I don't have an issue with more people on her side coming - I think it's great, but the disparity in the guest list is starting to bother me. I never wanted to be that entitled jerk that expects his friends/family to fork out thousands of dollars to come to their wedding, but when I see people who barely know me super excited and happy to come, it's kind of making me wonder why my side can't show the same degree of enthusiasm.

Should I hold them a bit more accountable to when they initially agreed and find out what the deal is or WIBTA if I did that? Thanks.","YTA. YTA. YTA. 

You plan a wedding that requires a huge cash outlay, then get upset because people can’t/won’t/don’t want to spend that kind of money. Now you are thinking about putting them on the spot and making them justify their reasons?

bjdkpk,"I work at a gas station and we are victim to minor shoplifting all the time. I catch someone shoplifting about once or twice a week. Usually what happens is when i catch someone, either i see them slide something into their pocket or purse or i see it through the security cam i go up to them and ask you're paying for that right and they take it out and pay for it. Usually they're just like oh yeah i am i just put it in my pocket cuz my hands are full or some other excuse. 

Yesterday I catch this punk ass kid come into the gas station with another friend anthey're blasting really horrible rap music with a lot of racial slurs and it was really derogatory towards women. Really garbage music. I tell him to turn it down and he ignores me. Im too busy dealing with customers so i focus on them. I look at the monitor and i watch him through the security came and i see him try sliding a couple cans of beer into his pockets and a few chocolate bars. He then selects a single bottle of gatorade and tries to purchase that. I then tell him to cut the bullshit and take everything out of his pockets. He then says ""yo man wtf you talking about, i just buying this gatorade"" and he then goes on accusing me of being racist against hispanic people thinking they're all thieves or something. I then show him the monitor of him sliding the chocolate and beers into his pockets. He then goes ""oh yeah sorry about that, i forgot about those"" (yeah right) and he then puts them out on the counter. The total was now longer 1.19 USD but now 15.55 (something like that) and he only had 2 one dollar bills and a few hundreds. I ask for his ID because he looks underage and he shows me something that is clearly fake. He hands me 100$ bill and i take the beer and the fake ID and told him to GTFO of the store because he's a fucking scumbag thief. He threatens to call the police on me and i told him to go ahead because they'd totally be on the side of a punk ass wannabe gangster who just tried to purchase alcohol and shoplift all caught on camera and he threatens to beat me up and walks out of the store. 

The next day he angrily calls me demanding i give him the 100 bucks back and i tell him to fuck off. I technically owe him like 95$ because he bought 5 dollars worth of chocolate but I'm not giving it back to some scumbag thief. HIs mom then calls me saying I'm a racist that doesn't like hispanic people and I'm bullying her son. She starts screaming at me in spanish and i just hang up.

cpj2k5,"This weekend my family got together to celebrate my mom's birthday. We were having a barbecue and some people voluntarily showed up to help set everything up, my sister and I included. Now my sister has a 6 month old baby and we were all aware that he would be coming with her and her husband. 

While our brother and I were helping our father cut up the ingredients my sister arrived. The baby was cranky but she managed to calm him down and then handed him to our niece. She went with her husband to set up a table outside and that was when the baby started crying. It was the most awful sound, he was pretty much screeching at the top of his lungs and his face turned bright red. Niece tried to calm him down but failed at it, so she called my sister back. My sister tells her to give him to her husband and that he'll calm him down. Her husband picks him up and she goes to find another task. The baby keeps crying so her husband takes him outside but we can still hear it. 

 I ask my sister if he's not hungry or something like it. She says that no he's just going through a clingy phase but he'll calm down. But the baby is still crying and at this point I was worried because I never saw something like it, so I asked her if she was sure of it and she said yes. I thought that maybe she just didn't want to be wrong so I tell her to take care of him and then she can help out later. She got annoyed at it and said that she knew her son better than I did and that she had discussed this already with his doctor and was following his advice.

After this things got a litte bit tense and my sister proceeded to ignore me for the rest of the day and this has been bugging me ever since.","YTA

Your sister is not the only parent to the baby, and it's kinda rude to assume that her husband, the freaking father of the baby, is not capable of taking care of the baby's needs.

Babies cry for numerous reasons (I had colics and was an absolute nightmare for my parents during my first year of life), and it's just... Well, they're humans, that's what humanity is like. It might be strange and very inconvenient for adult society, but if the parents are not mistreating the kid, you might just have to learn to deal with it.","I think the fact that it's been ""bugging you ever since"" should give you some perspective on your attitude about the whole situation and how it was handled. So in essentially yes, YTA.

efz1kb,"My stepsister (20F) and I (24M) have never gotten along. Her mom and my dad got married when we were six and ten so we've known each other for a long time. In my stepmom's eyes, she could do no wrong and anything bad that happened was pinned on me. My dad is a complete pushover so he would always fall over to whatever my stepmom would say.

When I was about 15, I started gaining weight. My gf broke up with me (woohoo high school romance), I started failing some of my classes, and I quit baseball. I started to stress-eat and ballooned up from 125 pounds to 162. I guess at that point she decided she was ""cooler"" than I was and started mocking me and making fun of me, calling me names like ""fatass"" and ""chubster"". I would constantly go to my stepmom about it and she would tell me she's just teasing, she's so much younger, why are you getting upset? I got pissed off to the point where I just started avoiding her and locking myself upstairs in my room with a bag of chips. At 22 I hit 270 pounds and I knew I had gone too far. I was way past my weight limit and bordering on obese. So as a New Year's resolution, I decided to start losing weight. I cut out all junk food and started hitting the gym. Around this time my stepsister started to overeat too, I don't really know why but she gained over 30 pounds. She still was constantly belittling me about my weight (which admittedly, was way over hers).

By the end of this year, I lost 120 lbs. It felt amazing. My stepsister now weighed more than me. Over Christmas dinner, all the aunts and uncles and cousins were complimenting me on my weight loss, telling me how I looked so much better. My stepsister just sat there smoldering. Every time someone said something she'd add, ""He's still pretty big"", ""Well he didn't get rid of that face roundness"", ""Maybe lose a little more around that gut"". It was infuriating and I was getting angrier.

Now here's where I might be TA. Finally, at her last little snide, ""Look, you know you'll just put it all back on. Why do you even bother?"" I flipped out. I yelled, ""Why can't you just be happy for me, instead of getting on me for every little thing?""She said back to me, ""Defensive much?""  
""Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your 200-pound feelings?"" I asked her. I probably should have stopped there but I kept going. ""Calling me a fatass. Look at your plate! You've eaten half the table, fatty!"" She started crying and left the table. My stepmom screamed at me, saying just because I was insecure I can't take it out on everyone. I said, ""Oh, so *now* you're talking. Not in the past ten years of constant 'fatty' and 'lardass' and 'porker'!""  
""But you're way older!"" she whined.

I left the table too and went home. I woke up today to a thousand messages from my stepmom, my dad, and my stepsister. They were saying I wasn't welcome to their house until I apologized. I'm not going to.

AITA?

EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for your comments and the awards. I've never felt better about myself than now. And yes, I understand that 270 lbs was not ""bordering"" on obese. I'm 6'0 so I was pretty damn obese. I called myself bordering for a few years after getting fat, it made me feel better than classifying myself as morbidly obese.",[removed],"&gt; Oh, so now you're talking.

awwu0e,"I have a girlfriend, Amy, who I’ve been with for 9 months. The girl who is mentioned in the title is Melissa my friend of 3 years. M is part of a group of 7 friends from college. 

About 4 months ago, Melissa and I planned a trip for our college friend group to go to Hawaii in May. Melissa was in charge of coordinating the trip with everyone else. She told me that she couldn’t get anyone to agree on dates or agree to the trip so it was just going to be the two of us. I asked about bringing Amy along but Melissa said that it would be a bad idea for me to plan a trip so far in the future with someone I had just started dating. This made sense so I decided not to invite Amy. At first, Amy was a little uncomfortable with some aspects of this trip (Melissa and I sharing a room) but was fine after I assured her that Melissa and I were just friends. 

Fast forward to Friday night. My college friends and I all go over to Melissa’s house to hang out and drink. Things are totally normal until around midnight after everyone else leaves and it’s just Melissa and me. Melissa started telling me about how excited she is for the Hawaii trip because it’s finally “our time” and that she’s been waiting for this for three years. I had no idea wtf she was talking about so I asked her to explain. She said she’s been in love with me since we first met and that she knows I feel the same way. Things clicked in my brain once she tried to kiss me. I told her that I wasn’t feeling well and left.  

Yesterday, I told Amy what happened and we had this conversation (not exact quotes obviously):

&gt; Amy: It sucks that you’ll have to cancel your Hawaii trip. Maybe we can go somewhere together that week instead. 

&gt; Me: Why would I cancel the Hawaii trip?

&gt; Amy: Because Melissa just admitted she’s in love with you and it would be inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her. 

&gt; Me: Look I would like to cancel the trip but, I’ve already paid a lot for this trip and some of it is non-refundable. It sucks that I’ll have to go with Melissa but if you trust me, you know that I would never allow for things to get inappropriate. 

&gt; Amy: I trust you and I don’t think you’d cheat but I still think it’s inappropriate to go on a trip alone with her.  

This went in for a while longer and Amy started to get mad and interrogate me about why it was so important for me to go on a trip with Melissa. By the end of the conversation, she said she was sure if she believed it was just about the money anymore. 

It honestly is just about the money. Ideally, I wouldn’t have to go with Melissa but I don’t see any other way out of this.

c7tygf,"My mother is notoriously tight with her money. Even though she has plenty, she is very particular with how she spends it. That is fine in most situations, but a few years ago I noticed she never tips when we eat out. 

My sister and I have Sunday lunch with her once a week, in which we each pay for ourselves. My sister and I always tip extra because we know our mother is going to stiff the server. It is incredibly frustrating and we have mentioned it to her several times. 

Yesterday we ate at a casual restaurant that has a waitstaff, but has you pay at a counter when you leave. My mother was the last to pay and the cashier asked if she wanted to leave a tip on her card, to which she said no. I asked my mom if she had cash she wanted me to take back to the table for her, to which she also said no. So I said ""so you just aren't going to leave a tip?"" and she said ""not today"". We went outside and she got very upset with me, saying I embarrassed her in front of the cashier and that I was being rude. I explained that not tipping was rude and that I was tired of always having to cover for her. She said ""not everybody tips"" to which I responded ""no, but everyone is supposed to"". She cancelled the rest of our plans for the day and left, informing me that I have no place to tell her what to do.

This upsets me more than anything because I was a server all through college and tips were how I survived. My mother knew this and listened when I complained about tables stiffing me, often seeming empathetic. I am mostly worried about how she acts when my sister and I aren't there to cover her tip. If she's with her friends, does she expect them to take care of it too? I'm embarrassed for her.

I was a little hurt that they waited this long to tell me (they told me just after that everyone else in the family has known for weeks but they wanted to wait to tell me in case something bad happened) but I put it down to me being immature or something. I told my parents congratulations and I'm happy they're happy. I could tell they were excited so I made sure to show an interest in the baby, but the more I think about it the less happy I am. I'm doing my exams this year (UK, GCSEs) and I will be doing exams for the next three years until I go to uni, and the whole time there's gonna be a screaming baby or a toddler in the house. I thought I was just being selfish, so I kept it to myself. My parents hadn't asked how I felt about the baby yet. 

The more I thought, the more problems I have with it. They mentioned that they're happy I'm old enough to 'babysit when they need a break' (I don't mind helping but I wouldn't want to do this) and that if something happened to them before my brother was grown up they're happy I would be able to take him. Their whole approach of making it seem like I'm a babysitter has honestly made me so sick of hearing about the baby. I don't want to part raise a kid, I want to do my exams and move out. I don't like children. My parents keep stressing that they're glad they'll have my help at their age. 

My mom could tell I was not so excited about it and she finally asked how I feel about the baby. I told her something like ""I'm glad you guys are happy, but I'm not excited to have a baby in the house.

I felt really guilty and said I'm sure I would love the baby when it's here, but at the moment I just feel a bit, idk, pushed out maybe?

My dad went off about what I said to my mom. My aunts (3 of them) have messaged me to say that I'm disrespectul and I should be glad I have a roof over my head (can't move out at 16 though) and my parents love me. I spoke to my friends about it and they all agree with me, but I'm wondering if it's just that I'm not mature enough to understand, which is something my uncle said to me. AITA?","NTA

First, you're 16 and this is going to disrupt your life a bit -- it's totally natural for you to be having these feelings and frankly I think you showed pretty good restraint.

Second, more generally speaking -- it's always bothered me that the social expectation is that you should be immediately happy for any pregnancy.","Yup YTA
But you're also 16 and reacting the way most 16yo would. How do I know? My baby sister is 16 years younger than me and born during my GCSEs too.

She's now 30 and I'm 46 and she is the person I am closest to in life other than my husband. We have a great relationship. And while I was furious that she was being born, and got roped into a lot of baby sitting (as well as looking after my two other younger siblings) I wouldn't be without her.

Why are you the asshole? Because you don't get to have an opinion on whether you have brothers or sisters or not. That's about your parents relationship and you get no say in that. But you'll realise that when you're older.",0,0
dkw63y,"So, i am an atheist but my mother is a buddhist and recently my father passed away, even though he was also an atheist my mother decided to do a buddhist funeral to sent him off,now i dont believe in any kind of spirit or gods or ghosts, so i just didnt want to participate in any of these prayers, but i just kept getting forced, but all i wanted to do was to be alone and have some quiet time but my releatives kept telling me i had to pray, during the third day when we were supposed to send his spirit away, i just kept quiet and stayed in my room but my religious aunts and uncles kept on knocking on my doors saying ""its time to send your dads spirit away, STOP BEING SO DISRESPECTFUL"" , i just wanted to grief in my own way but i had to keep getting forced to do it their way,so people of the internet, AITA for not doing what my religious family kept telling me to do?

edit: prior to the last day i had done everything that they told me to do, kneel/pray/say a word of passing/ etc. but in the end i just couldn't keep up anymore and just shut myself away","Edit : NTA (previously Y-T-A (tiny bit)) 

I've been an atheist for as long as I can remember and I participate fully in all rituals with my Hindu/Buddhist family as long as it isn't too toxic. I've also gone to church and mosque and when asked to pray do some silent self-meditation.

This is not just your family's religion, it's their *culture* and it's your culture as well. Your lack of belief doesn't need to include rejecting your family's rituals if they aren't causing harm. Funeral rites are a way for loved ones to gather and celebrate the person who has passed away. It brings people together. I would suggest you participate but instead of thinking of everything as meaningless, give each ritual your *own* meaning in private. Let each incense stick you light represent a good memory with your father, for instance.

Death is hard and complicated to deal with. Don't push away your loved ones unnecessarily, they are there to support you.

Edit: Having read your updates, clearly you are doing nothing wrong! You've done as much as you can and your relatives are pushing you to do something that would be distasteful to any person, let alone someone who is grieving! I'm glad your mom is backing you up here.

de0ayo,"My girlfriend and I just had our 10th month ""anniversary"" and she wanted to do something because it's ""pretty special"". Previously I tried to do something for each month's anniversary because that's what she wanted, even if it was just seeing her. This time (a thursday) I was busy and asked if we could do something on the weekend instead. She said it wouldnt be as special and not to worry. It was in that tone where ""everything's fine"". Internally I was mad but tried not to be too flippant with her. I had a big week and enough on my weekend that I just wanted to rest in the spare time I had so I let it go but told her my saturday night was free. 
After that I felt myself becoming resentful. Anniversary to me is annual. Celebrating each month feels like it takes away from the actual anniversary. The second month I tried to mention it and she responded with something along the lines with ""I know, I just think it's special, don't you?"" Not wanting to upset her I just agreed.

She didn't end up coming over, she said I had a busy week and needed to rest. I'm never too tired to see her but this time I was and just accepted it. 

Another thing to note is I try to take her on dates when I can but it's another thing I don't really care for. I'm often tired and tight with money, I'd rather just stay in with her.","NAH.

I'm guessing you guys are pretty young, I haven't really heard of ""monthly anniversaries"" since teenage years or maybe early 20s at latest.

You mention anniversaries being annual which is spot on, derived from ""annus"" (year) and ""versus"" (turned). Basically ""turned yearly"".

9kyonh,"Okay, calm down, I’m not advocating violence here. And he was maybe 13 or 14, who knows. 

So here’s the story, I was waiting for a bus this evening on my way home from work, and there were maybe a group of 6 - 8 young boys at the bus stop just hanging out, and they started throwing sticks at me. And I know that they really just wanted attention so I ignored them for 5 minutes, then I told them to “fuck off”, and that got them super excited and started throwing more sticks me. 

And at that point I just lost it, I turned around and asked who did it, bunch of them pointed to one, that boy was giggling and making a chinky eye face at me (I’m a tiny Asian girl), so I went up to him, grabbed his arm and slapped him in the face. On a scale of 1 to 10, I think that slap was a 7, it was loud, pretty solid considering this is the first time I ever slapped anyone.

And the other boys fled, the one got slapped was cursing and screaming, tried to kick me but failed, cursed more and made a lot more faces. I think they were definitely talking racist shit in Dutch (I live in Amsterdam), some adults at the bus stop started yelling back at them. They stood at the other side of the road, looking really salty, until the bus came and I got home. 

TLDR: boy throw sticks at me, boy talk shit at me, boy got slapped.

d05o4l,"I know what it sounds like, but hear me out. 

My fiancé and I have been together about 6 years now. He had one dog (K) when we started dating and decided to get another one shortly after (W). 

In the last year and a half W has started to show aggressive tendencies towards K. It started when they were eating or given treats. So we put them in a set feeding schedule and separated them any time they ate. It seemed to work for the most part. 
There was an instance during this time where W got K so bad, he’s now missing a little chunk of his ear and had to get a few stitches on his face. 

We currently live with my fiancé’s family and we all moved to a new house two months ago. On moving day, there was a bad altercation between the two that was harder to break up than usual because we had already moved most of the stuff out of the house. My fiancé had to put himself between the two and got bit. Luckily he didn’t need stitches though. 

The attacks have increased in frequency and in randomness of cause. One time my fiancé thinks it had to do with seeing W lick a crumb off the floor in the kitchen. The one last night was because someone was eating food at the dinner table. They didn’t drop anything or pay attention to the dogs, and W still attacked K. That was the third attack in the last week. 

I strongly believe it is a matter of time before W turns on one of us or one of the cats in the house. I also believe it isn’t safe for K to be around her anymore either. My fiancé did take W to get some bloodwork done and is hoping there is a physical reason for this, but I’m pretty sure we’ve done these tests before and the vet came back with nothing. I asked him what if the bloodwork comes back with no reason for the aggression, and he said he’d find training for her. 

I’ve heard the training thing before, and he never did anything with it. And even if she were “trained” I don’t think the aggression will ever really go away. I could never trust her around small children. I told him all of this, and he just doesn’t seem to take it seriously. 

I flat out told him to get rid of her, and even though he’s considered it before, he’s totally shutting out the idea now. I told him I don’t believe W belongs in a home with other dogs at all, but he doesn’t agree. I also said there’s no world where I would let my future children live in the same house as that dog. He insists she’ll never attack a person because she hasn’t before (like a toddler picking up a piece of food would be different than if K got food in front of W). We haven’t spoke to each other since this conversation earlier today. 

So, AMITA?","Tough one, but ultimately deciding with NTA. The dog is a threat to your other dog. It is your moral obligation to keep both animals safe. With W in the picture, neither dog is safe.

That being said, I would absolutely 100% consider training before removing the dog from the household. Why can’t you train the dog or find someone to train the dog?

Edit: just to clarify, I believe if you do not even attempt at training the dog, you will be the asshole. Aggressive behavior can be stopped with training. I just think you are nta for considering getting rid of the dog if training for whatever reason does not work out (whereas it seems your SO wouldn’t consider that, making him TA in my eyes)",[deleted],0,0
clx62w,"My car was shaking when I braked from high speeds, my dad told me it was the rotors and I believed him but the deal I got the car from has free diagnostic so I took it there. 

So my dad was right, it was the rotors. My friend had just done the brake pads like a month ago but not the rotors. So the dealer guy said it'll be 650 to get all four rotors shaved down and an oil change (synthetic oil so oil change is like 90 bucks itself). I said ok. 

He calls me like an hour later and says his guy started cutting the front rotors and it wasn't gonna work so they needed to replace all 4 four 850. I asked if they cut the backs ones yet and he said no. I specially said *do not* cut the backs ones ""do as little as possible"". 

He calls me again and says his guy cut a back rotor and it wasn't gonna work so I needed to replace those too as it was too uneven now. I said I told you not to cut those and he was like ""I was just tryna to help you out""


I'm fuming at this point, go to pick up my car. It's 750 for the two front rotors and the oil change (when they had quoted me 850 for all 4 and the oil change?!). I pay and leave. My car is literally not drivable  it's so shaky. I bring it back and tell him the car is dangerous at this point and it needs to be fixed.

cgebuj,"Throwaway because my best friend uses reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

My best friend of over 10 years broke up with her boyfriend last week. I haven't known him for long but he was a great guy and we got along. She had been debating to break up with him for weeks, due to certain trauma she went through, which led to her not feeling comfortable being with him. She told me more in depth about her trauma and also about how she felt while being with him. She made me promise not to tell. My friend also had a feeling that he'd ask me to go out but I said I would never do it as I know it would make her uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the problem. He texted me two days ago at 1 am, asking to meet up with me. I hesitated at first but then he said he really needed a friend. I felt bad so I went. He proceeded to ask me why she chose to do this, and how she felt, and personal stuff. He seemed so heartbroken I just had to tell him.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning my friend texted me being extremely pissed off that I went out with him and told him stuff about her, which she found out because he told her.

She started going off about how if I get everything done then we can both relax together and I was just making excuses to sit around and play games.

cve2hi,"This isnt anything major that I did, but my sister thinks I shouldnt have said anything. Anyway, on to what happened...


My mom loves to abbreviate things, she thinks it is fun. She also loves to golf. She says things like ""You have a BO"" (meaning birdie opportunity), ""FISA"" (meaning F__ I'm Still Away), and a few others as well as a bunch that have nothing to do with golf. 


For those of you who don't golf on a regular basis, knowing your distance from your target is important on every shot.

The next two times, I let it slide because I was still getting a feel about her dressing habits and my husband had me slightly convinced for a while that it was not as big of a deal as I was making it out to be. 


The fourth time she came over, she was wearing a belly shirt and no bra. I complimented her figure, but I asked her if she could please tone it down and dress more modestly around us because I have two children here. She agreed without arguing. I didn’t say this to her but I think it’s a little inappropriate to dress like that in someone else’s home, whether or not there are children around. 


The last time she came over, she was wearing the most she has ever worn. She wore a long-sleeve crew neck, but again no bra. I must have not made it perfectly clear about her nipple issue, but I made sure she knew today. I asked her to wear a bra, pasties, or whatever necessary to hide her permanent erect nipples whenever she visited us. She agreed without arguing again. I asked her if she wears a bra at work and she said she does, but lets them breathe as soon as she gets off. I was happy that it was so easy. 


However, I heard from my daughter today that my son’s girlfriend complained about my prudeness to her and my two sons. I asked my daughter if she thought it was inappropriate of her to wear those outfits at our house and she said doesn’t think so at all. I think I’m being totally reasonable. I taught my daughter that it actually is a little disrespectful of my son’s girlfriend and told my daughter that she better not dress like that in any similar situations in the future. My husband isn’t too invested in this matter even though he still thinks it’s not as big of a deal as I made it out to be.","YTA.

I don't know why women from a different generation seem so obsessed with erect nipples or visible nipples under the shirt, going braless, etc. but nipples, visible or not, does not harm anyone and does not command attention.

Your son's gf's body is NOT yours to dictate and no, you cannot tell someone to dress a certain way. She might not like your fashion choices either but she's not telling you to dress like her either. Lay off.","YTA for asking any young woman to wear a bra. They're just nipples, who cares if they're see through shirts? She dressed more modestly for you and I don't think YTA for asking for that but asking her to wear a bra definitely makes you one.",1,1
esm910,"Tonight, my parents (60m &amp; 57f) invited me (28f) to a movie. We carpooled with my dad driving. A couple minutes in, I ask if he could turn his audiobook down. I was sitting right near the speaker and it was really hurting my ears. He turns it down 1 notch, which doesn't make a difference. I ask again if he could please turn it down a little.

He blew up. He said that I need to learn how to respect other people's property. I said I was just making a normal request. If someone was in my car and asked me to turn my music down, I would. He said that's not the way the world works and that I need to f-ing grow up. He said when someone invites you to ride in their car you respect their rules. I get this as a concept, but I think the volume is a common courtesy thing. He told me to ""f-ing hush.""

At this point, I was like, great, this is what I'm in for tonight. I ask if he could take me back home. He says no. So I was like okay, well could you drop me at the gas station right there so I can just get a Lyft? He tells me I need to learn how to face conflict head on and talk it through.

I'm really frustrated now. I point out that he told me to f-ing hush, which is not conducive to ""talking it through."" He continues to tell me how I always ""run away like a little child"" and I've done this since I was 16 years old.

My mom keeps saying things like, ""y'all please"" and ""don't do this"" and is almost crying. My dad gets pissed at me for ""making her cry""  and ""ruining the evening."" He turns his audiobook back up  and makes a big show of fading it to the front.

We arrive at the movies. I say hey, y'all go on in and enjoy but I'm gonna get a Lyft and head home. My dad again accuses me of acting like a child. I say no, I'm just trying to leave an uncomfortable and disrespectful situation.

My mom asks if we can both apologize. My dad apologizes in a sarcastic way, including a bow/curtsy move. I say I have nothing to apologize for. I repeat that I'm just trying to remove myself from a disrespectful situation. My mom asks if I can just sit next to her. I explain that that just makes her a buffer and I'm not going to spend 2 hours with them after being spoken to like that. My dad opens the door to the movies and says, ""get the f out of here and go home then.""

My lyft is 3 minutes away when my parents come back out. My dad insists on driving me home. It's silent the whole way.

Now, if this had been just an annoying parent situation, I could let it lie. But how he spoke to me felt demeaning and controlling. This isn't an uncommon occurence with him - that's why he referenced me ""running away."" He speaks to people in such an ugly way and then doesn't allow them to speak, so there's no point in trying to ""talk it through."" The only way I've successfully found to deal with it is to remove myself. Am I really being immature by doing this?","NTA- You did exactly what you should've. You sound like you were calm and polite as possible the whole time, and your father was unnecessarily rude and disrespectful.

bt1kl0,"Throwaway in case my coworkers use reddit. I am a 22 year old female. I recently took a serving job for the summer to save up money before I move in the fall. I live in a suburb of a city and the restaurant is about 30min away from  where i currently live. before accepting the job I informed the manager that I would that I would only really be able to work morning or midday shifts because 1.) i have another job i do in the evenings and 2.) I live further away and the restaurant is in a slightly sketchy area of town, so I would not feel comfortable leaving the restaurant alone after closing at 3am (and then having to drive 30min home). He said those both were fine and that he could work with it. I just started this job about a week ago. I know the restaurant is short on staff currently so they need servers.

They asked my availability for the next week and i told them i could work mornings Or afternoons during the week and an evening shift Saturday. Out comes the weekly schedule for next week and the only two times they scheduled me were both closing shifts that have me working well past midnight. I expressed to the manager that I was uncomfortable with closing, and he basically brushed it off. 

I really need the job but I feel upset that the managers (who are both mid-30s men, so perhaps they just don’t understand the concern, but still) are not taking my concerns for my own safety/sake of feeling comfortable seriously. A few of the other female servers have also said that they dislike closing so they work mostly mornings, so I do not feel that my request was out of line, especially since I am a younger female and the area is not in the best part of town. 

I don’t want to leave them short on servers by quitting for such a possibly stupid reason, but I’m worried that this pattern is going to continue. WIBTA if I quit and left them short on staff because they aren’t respecting my concerns about the closing shift and possible safety? Or am i being too worrisome/should just suck it up? I am leaving in a month and a half so it’s not like this is a long term gig, either. 

TL;DR: I am a younger female working at a bar/restaurant in a sketchy-ish area of town.

d0d4ib,"  Context: I have considered moving to my grandmothers because we live in a very small apartment to fit a family of 4 in. Me, my brother, dad, and stepmom. I dont want to move out b/c of problems w my family, I just need more space that my grandmother is willing to offer.

 Anyways, back during I believe Christmas 2013 or 2014 when the PS4 was released, we decided to buy one for the family, since I played video games and so did my brother (as well as to watch movies, youtube, etc). We were financially unstable at the time but my dad wanted to spend his bonus to get a nice gift for the family. I offered to help pay half of the price for him with money I had made working w/ family and neighbors. So we both paid ~200$ to purchase the console. 

   Over the years I have accumulated &lt;100 games on the console on my Playstation account library, which everybody has access to. I have paid over 500$ total in purchasing games, ingame content, DLC, etc; of which my dad and brother use. I dont care if they do because it doesnt affect me but I am the primary user of the PS4. Ive told my dad I want to take it but I would be glad to both buy another playstation (they are much cheaper now) and allow them access to my account and therefore my 100 or so purchased games. 

    I am afraid that if I say I am taking the console my dad will get upset or angry at me. So, would I be the asshole for taking the family console when I move which I have paid for in majority, albeit helping buy a new console for my dad and brother as well as allowing them to access my games and Netflix account?","Honestly talk to your dad, tell him you’ll go half on a new consol like you did with this one and you’ll split the games.

I'm 28 and don't drive. I wanted to go see one of my best friends in Tampa, Fl (35 minutes from where I live). I wanted to be the least inconvenience as possible, so if I were to get a ride I wanted to be where people were going to be anyways. I got some friends who wanted to see her to take me up, hang out, and drop me off for a few days, and My sister, who said she would be in Tampa anyways, agreed to pick me up on her way back home. I confirmed multiple times and would have planned another week if she could not. But she said it was fine and everything was set. I've been up for three days, and the day before she was supposed to get me our cousin gets in an accident and doesnt want to see my sister, so she decides to cancel everything and doesnt want to get me. I know I have other ways down, but I feel, personally, betrayed and highly annoyed that she can just brush me off like that. But the thing is, if shes not going to be up, should she feel obligated to get me?

I know I should be driving at my age, but I never needed to, so I wanted this to work for everyone, not just me.

But I just need to know if im being a prick for still expecting her to drive 30 minutes to not leave me in Tampa with a 70$ Lyft Bill.

dobf8w,"Long and on mobile so please be patient! I in no way think anyone is an actual asshole here, but I’m curious what other people think. I (f30) have been with my girlfriend (f32) for two years. It’s the most healthy relationship I have ever been in and she treats me very well. We have a lot in common and have great communication. We also both suffer from anxiety. Let me preface this by saying I have done a ton of work on my anxiety this year alone. My girlfriend has always been very supportive, and works on herself constantly.  My biggest phobia is flying. Last time I tried getting on a plane was 8 years ago. I panicked and pushed through people to get off of it (while on Xanax). Haven’t wanted to do it again since. My girlfriend LOVES to travel. I enjoy getting out of town, and we do that a few times a month, sticking to surrounding cities and states. This is more than enough travel for me.  Now to our dilemma: she and her mom (who also is very adventurous) are taking a trip to Costa Rica next year, and she really wants me to go. We talked about it and here are some reasons I say no: It’s a one hour flight, and then four hour flight to get there. I have sedatives I can take, but i would have to take quite a bit and I’m scared of drugging myself back to back for each flight.  I also don’t want to embarrass myself in front of her mom by being an anxious mess, as we are still establishing a relationship. I also don’t really want to spend over 1500$ as I make less than her, and we also have events coming up we need to save for.  She expressed last night being bummed I won’t be there, and would like to try a smaller flight soon to see how I do. Though I would like to travel at some point within the states, and I want to make my gf happy, it’s honestly really not that important to me to travel out of country, or to work on this phobia right now as I have plenty other smaller, more pertinent ones to tackle first. I know I’ll be sad and upset knowing I’m not on a beach having fun with her, but I really don’t see myself going through all that anytime soon.

azj63x,"I matched a woman on dating app, and all went well as we have similar interest on movie, TV etc. We even met up once beforehand and feel that we match.

However all seems changed on the second date. (This may be long) In the beginning of the date, she brought me a present for my birthday, and I was pleasantly surprised. We made some banter and joked that since my birthday already passed, she should save up on the next occassion, like Christmas. (Not yet relevant, but will be later)

On my chatting, she also let loose that she is passive aggressive and she likes to be. Things start to turn south when I think she starts to flaunting passive aggressiveness, such as ""she may break up with me for bringing her to a bad restaunrant"" or joking ""she may be a man and I should break up with her"" and quite a bit of taunting that I should, which I think is a bit over.

We were also getting a bit touchy, but suddenly saying that I'm no longer allowed because I brought her to a bad restaurant. I'm only allowed to touch her again if I bring her to a nice restaurant in our next date. She also said ""I need to pay because I brought her to a bad restaurant"", which I was planning to anyway because it is true that she was not enjoying it.

Finally when we said goodbye, she told me she's keeping the present for Christmas, as we joked before. I was very miffed by it.

So overall I thought that 1) she is passive aggressive and likes it, 2) she brings jokes way too far for me to be comfortable and 3) she leverages reward/punishment towards me.

When I boarded, the older lady next to me leaned over and told me I was rude for boarding a plane in this state. I immediate felt terrible and started apologizing profusely.

A bit later I was still feeling bad and decided to offer to by her and alcoholic drink as an apology. Big mistake...

She turned out to be Mormon and I guess I had stepped to far. She begins to shout me down full shouting mode at this point and several passengers started to shame me as well.

asbqav,"My boyfriend and I have been dating about 3 years, both in our late 40's. He is extremely thrifty - hates throwing anything away, and rarely buys anything new (clothes, furniture, you name it). One of his points of pride is recycling wrapping paper from past gift exchanges. He said he hasn't bought wrapping paper in years; he just keeps it when someone gives him a gift, and recycles it. When he gives a gift, he often asks for the paper back to be used again. So, gifts from him always come wrapped in paper that has tons of creases and folds, and it just is what it is. I generally don't mind, and it is kind of a running joke at this point.

Cut to Valentine's Day this year, and he gave me two gifts wrapped in paper with hearts and the word ""love"" all over it. As per usual, the paper had lots of creases and folds and was obviously re-used (I recognize basically all the wrapping paper he has used in the past 3 years, but had never seen this particular paper before). I asked if this had been given to him on a gift by a past girlfriend, and he said yes it had. He said he couldn't remember which girlfriend had given it to him (which I doubt; he remembers everything). I didn't make a HUGE huge deal, but I did point out that it doesn't exactly make me feel special to be given something wrapped in paper from a past love relationship. He didn't understand why I would care, and that he thought this paper would be perfect and romantic. So, I was mildly annoyed and then he reacted by being mildly annoyed. He said I shouldn't have even said anything, and to pick my battles.

d17rri,"This is a story about me, my friend Mary(white) and my friend Jane(black), not real name ofcourse  We all belongs to a fan group of Anime addicts. We share our fan theories, fan arts and cosplays(dressing up as characters in the shows). Occasionally the mods would organize competitions and we would vote for the best work in the group.


We are currently having a cosplay competition, both Mary and Jane participated and both of them cosplayed as Kamado Nezuko, along with 7 others. Both of them did a pretty good job actually, but I only had 1 vote and I voted for Mary.


Jane private messaged me and asked why did I vote for Mary as she thinks she put more work into her costume and deserves my vote. I replied that because I think Mary looked more similar to Nezuko in the anime. Jane argued that her bamboo(part of the decal of the character) looked more realistic than Mary, the fabric she used for the costume was better quality etc. I then said that Mary’s skin is fairer and thus looked closer to Nezuko. 


Jane was obviously upset by my words. She pointed out that since Nezuko was Japanese,  an ideal cosplayer should be asian, not white. So the reason that I HAD to pick Mary is because I am a racist bitch. I don’t think Jane should get upset over such things nor demanding to be voted. There are other Nezuko cosplayers but I picked 1 between Mary and Jane because Mary is my friend too. In all honesty I think Mary did a better job than Jane, with skin color playing a factor, not going to deny that but I don’t mean to be racist or bitchy over it. AITA?


Edit: I judge on how similar they look from the actual character, and Mary looks younger too because she is a small lady with some chubs, and the character is 14. Maybe I would pick Jane if she chose to cosplay something that suit her(she has a very good figure, definitely look better as than adult than a child). I don't cosplay and I don't think Jane did a bad job, but if I pick 1 from the 2 I pick Mary because she looks like Nezuko more.","from what i’ve heard, this is a huge issue in the cosplay community. people are often focused on the physical appearance of the cosplayer, rather than the costume and it often stops people from doing what they love. 

you overlooked everything that made ‘jane’s’ cosplay better because she wasn’t white. maybe she got a little upset but that’s understandable. i’m sorry, but YTA.","YTA. Cosplay is not only about craftsmanship and quality of the work but more importantly it’s about the cosplayer’s love of the character and expressing through costuming . Saying someone’s cosplay was better due to an individual’s race is really harmful thinking. The cosplay community already has a huge issue with racism and just because someone’s skin color isn’t the same as a character, doesn’t diminish the cosplay itself.

I struggle finding dresses that fit me well and anything I really like. When I went shopping, I finally found a really nice, white dress. I put it on the page while shopping and a bunch of people said “This is the same dress as Kelly\*” (not her real name). I am not friends with Kelly, but we’re also not enemies or anything. I saw her dress and it was the same dress, but a different color (hers was pink). I messaged her on FB and she asked that I not get my dress, because she spent so long looking for hers and she wanted to feel unique. We went to a small school so the odds of anyone else having the dress were going to be low. So, at first, I said okay. But the more I looked, the more I really couldn’t find a dress that I really loved. I kept thinking of that dress. So, I ended up buying it but not saying anything. I just told some very close friends that I was getting the dress in question.

Come prom night, I show up. Kelly doesn’t seem me at first, but one of her friends does and screams “Kelly!!!” She turns around, sees me and makes this angry face, but doesn’t say anything to me for the rest of the night. A lot of people said they were proud of me for not listening to Kelly, because she shouldn’t get to dictate what I wore. Especially as we weren’t friends or anything and it really didn’t matter. I had a really fun time at prom and there was no drama.

However, even after graduation, Kelly is still pissed about it. I ran into her recently and she was ice cold. Like I said, we were never friends, but we were at least cordial prior to this. However, she acts like it’s an ultimate betrayal. My friend, who is friends with one of her friends says, that Kelly feels I ruined her prom.

AITA for not changing my dress?","NTA. The dresses weren’t even the same color. 

The best part of high school ending is the fact that people like Kelly cease mattering. Don’t worry and let it go.","NTA.  Sooner than you realize, all that high school drama won’t matter anymore.  Hope you had fun at prom.  

Incidentally, a dress shop in my area keeps an annual record of what school girls go to and which dress they bought, so there won’t be any duplicates.  Found that out when I took my daughter dress shopping last spring.  

There was a girl shopping the day we were there and she found a dress she loved, but they wouldn’t sell it to her because another girl from her school already bought that dress.",0,0
ckoqnp,"UPDATE: I have no amount of thanks worthy to the comment that suggested homeowners insurance. After calling, it looks like they are willing to cover half of the amount. As for the BS ambulance charge, my boyfriend called the hospital and tore them to shreds over it, and it has now been removed. He's also filed a formal complaint against them. As for the remaining 600 euros, his mother actually offered to split it with me, and sincerely apologized for the poisoning and how she acted. This was actually a huge step forward for her, so my bf also offered to pitch in. So yeah. The incident is now over with and we're all moving on and going for dinner somewhere today. Surprisingly happy ending. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago, my boyfriend and I were out visiting his mother at her country house. His brother and sister-in-law, and his sister were also there. The farm has loads of fruit/veggies/berries/herbs/etc growing, and a lot of it is natural, so one evening, his mother decided to make a berry pie. She's cooking the berry mixture, and my boyfriend and I notice it smells strange when we walk into the kitchen. We comment on it, and his mum gets all huffy, saying she's lived out here for ages and knows what to pick.

Obviously she doesn't because about 30-45mins after we eat it, we're all being rushed to the hospital, vomiting and feverish. His mother and sister go in an ambulance, and my boyfriend, myself and his brother and sister-in-law have a neighbour drive us. Because this isn't my home country, I have private insurance while I'm waiting on approval for permanent residency ( bf+his fam have free, national health care). The insurance company I use prefers it if we call to clear our issue before going to the hospital (provided we're able to). I call and explain the situation, and the guy I talk to gives me the all clear to go to the hospital and get treatment.

A couple weeks later, I get a bill from the hospital for 700euros and a letter from the hospital informing me that my insurance won't cover it because the situation was ""preventable"". They even charged me for the ambulance that I didn't use. I call my insurance company, stating the guy I called before I went to the hospital said I was cleared, and they give me some BS answer about that decision not being binding, and that after reviewing the instance I'm not eligible, blah blah. I then call the hospital and try to argue the ambulance charge, but they stand firm claiming that the ambulance was for the group.

I talk to my parents about this, and they think my boyfriend's mum should pay because it was her mistake, and she paid everyone else's hospital fee (about 20euros each). I feel a bit awkward asking, but after some deliberation I send her a message asking her to pay it (minus the cost of the medications and ambulance (was a sh\*t charge but I don't feel it's fair to ask her to pay that)). So I'm asking for roughly 500euros.

She takes this as a super personal attack, and both my boyfriend's siblings think I'm being unreasonable and causing her unnecessary stress. She says it was an accident, and she shouldn't have to pay for it because it was just a mistake. I understand that it was a mistake, but it was avoidable if she paid attention to what berries she was picking. My boyfriend is trying to stay out of it, as it's just been over the last year where he's patched up his relationship with his mother, so he doesn't want to damage it (which I 100% understand). He thinks neither of us are wrong, but isn't sure who's right.

AITA for asking her to pay, since it was her mistake?",NTA! And you need to challenge this bill because of inaccuracies.,NTA. Make your boyfriend pay it if she wont and he cant stay out of it. Its his mom if you dont feel comfortable he needs to talk to his own mother. What if you had died. Yeah it was a mistake but still her fault,0,0
c9ehjo,"My wife's quite upset at me after I bought about $150 or so worth of school supplies that I planned to donate to a nearby school, and wanted to try and keep a secret about it. However, she managed to pry in and figured out what I was doing, which infuriated her. 

The reason why I never told her was that I wanted to keep my donation more anonymous and discrete. My wife likes to talk to people about what she's doing, to gain recognition about what's she's trying to do. A week or so ago, she also donated school supplies to the school I'm donating to as well, and she came in personally to hand supplies out to students. I believe she's doing that simply to make herself look better and to gain a lot of recognition in doing so, and I just don't like that. 

Before you go on, I didn't do this to simply one-up her. The supplies I saw in the store were on sale, and I was simply inspired to do something too. That's all. It wouldn't have mattered anyways since no one would have known.

I wanted to simply drop the supplies off and have the principal do what they wanted with it. I didn't tell my wife because I was worried about her spilling the beans out to other people about what I was doing, and spreading the word. I also wanted to teach this as a lesson to my kids to try and do things without expecting fame and stuff in return.

Edit 1: I didn't realize this until people commented, but about money, yes, while we do share finances, she didn't mention that as an issue in our argument. That's a possibility, but I doubt it because she spent about the same as I did when donating.","YTA. Keeping your donations discrete is one thing.

e4jq4t,"So the title might seem like I am one of those Choosing beggar types, but it is a a lot different, I think so at least but I am here for judgement for a reason.

Now me and my girlfriend started dating about a year and a half ago and she moved in with me around 3 months ago. My girlfriend had just quit her previous job and took a job at a tattoo shop because it is her dream to start her own shop some day, with this came a large income drop for her which was part of the reason she moved in with me of course the large reason was because this was the logical next step in our relationship and we are in love. As a result I have been paying the vast majority of bills given I make several times more money and she could not possibily afford paying half, which is something I am okay with.

That brings us to this week, I have been thinking of getting a large tattoo on my shoulder towards my chest. I had local tattoo artist in mind and it would likely end up costing me several hundreds, which I was okay with.

So after deciding all of that I shared the news with my girlfriend during dinner and she seemed upset after I told her. At night before bed I asked her what was wrong and she told me she was upset I didn't ask her to do it and she said she really wants to do it, essentially she offered to do it.

Now I had a think about it and I still had my doubts since I really liked the other artists work, but she is good at her job and I decided to take her up on her offer, given she has her own kit and everything and it would be more meaningful to me if it was her putting it on me, you know? Also it would make her happy if she gets to do it which was a factor in the decision.

So a few days pass and she essentially starts telling me how much it would cost which was a few hundreds over what I was expecting it to cost, now I bit my tongue more or less and told her I needed some more time to think and figure out the finances but that is where my aita question comes in.

In my mind.
1: She offered to tattoo me and was upset I was going to be tattooed by someone else.
2: Between the two of us I cant help but sort of feeling a bit fucked over since I already pay so much more towards the bills, so it seems to be she could at least cut out the labour costs.

On the other hand I know this tattoo would be hours upon hours of work which is why I feel bad about thinking this way.

So render onto me thou judgement.","NTA and I would advise you to just let the other artist do it. If you two ever decide to split you will have this huge reminder of her on your chest every day. I have a tattoo my ex picked out for me and even though it is nothing to do with him and even though he wasn’t the one who tattooed me, I have a giant reminder of our relationship on my wrist for the rest of my life",NTA. only because she offered and then expects you to pay when you could get it done for cheaper,0,0
eb6svs,"I was cycling to work during rush hour in an urban area. This was a shared path for cyclists and pedestrians, characterised by a blue line on the side and little graphics on the ground every few meters.

I stopped to wait at a set of traffic lights among a few pedestrians. While stopped, a lady walked up from behind me and jaywalked across.

When my light turned green, I crossed and quickly caught up to her. She was walking in the middle of the path making it difficult for me to pass. I rang my bell but didn't get her attention (this frequently happens and is just part of cycling). I repeatedly rang my bell, and called out to say excuse me a few times. I couldn't pass because of a wall on the right, and a garden on the left separating the path from the road. There were no spaces coming up to overtake more comfortably.

I very slowly moved my bike into the gap between this lady and the wall, intending for her to see me and step aside. I was moving at about a fast-walking pace. Within a few seconds I get clear of her and speed up to a more comfortable pace.

She yells out ""I'm f*ing deaf you tw*t!""

I really had no idea that this lady was deaf, but in hindsight probably should have guessed. 

This lady had just passed me at the lights, so knew I would be coming up behind her very shortly. Being on a shared path, at rush hour, and particularly as a deaf pedestrian, I would have hoped that she would think to be somewhat alert and try to be aware of her surroundings and kept to the side. I don't think there was any other way I could have passed her short of dismounting my bike and passing at the same speed anyway, but then the overtaking issue is the same, and makes cycling to work less viable overall.

I feel like her response was way disproportionate to the situation.

I've been feeling sour and conflicted about the whole thing all morning which makes me wonder how it should have played out in an ideal world.","NTA

You did all the right things and it's on her to be careful and aware of her surroundings.  She was rude to be walking in a way that prevents others from getting past her.","NTA

My co worker works Thursday through Monday and picks up Tuesdays.  School starts in August as I’m close to getting into a nursing program.  I won’t be able to work the Wednesday because school is Monday and Wednesday.  I have seniority over my coworker as we are in a union and I’m going to ask my boss for the Tuesday that he’s been working for a few months.  These days are enhanced hours and are not part of a shift and are up for grabs. I asked my coworker if he’d be able to switch and he gave me a story about having to get his daughter to dance on Wednesday... but he used to work seven days a week and was recently laid off from his job so he took more hours at our current job.

ebxfb3,"Boyfriend and I are from the same hometown but live in another province. We both come home for Christmas every year.

The thing is, Christmas at my house sucks. My mom loves christmas while the rest of the family is indifferent to it. She is also paraplegic so she makes my dad do all the set up for Christmas, and tries to do things herself, and gets upset and throws a fit when she can't get something done. I do try to help her when I see her struggle but she has never fully come to terms with the fact that she cannot be independent, and will try to do things she cannot do while no one is around, which is when she ends up having a meltdown. My parents are also super broke but don't budget Christmas and it breaks my heart seeing them put themselves into even more debt just so that they can gift me a 300$ item that I don't really need. I have a lot of tension with my mom over a variety of issues but I usually put on a smile and tolerate a lot because she isn't all there mentally and is quite depressed. 

Last year, I spent Christmas eve with my boyfriend's family and Christmas day with my family. Christmas eve was lovely. I never enjoyed christmas and was always a bit of a grinch before I started spending Christmas with my boyfriend's family. Their house is beautifully done up, they put classic christmas music on, we all sit together in the living room drinking and chatting. The food was amazing. His parents made sure to have the fixings for my favourite cocktail. At my family dinner, my parents argued because my mom refused to believe the turkey needed more time in the oven (it did), we ended up eating in complete silence after 9pm, and up until dinner my parents sat and watched TV. I tried to get them to come sit in the living room and chat but they didn't want to, so I went downstairs and watched TV alone until supper. Their house is a huge mess overflowing with crap they don't need and haven't used in years. Their Christmas tree is broken and only the top half lights up. Mom got mad at me for trying to fix it with some string lights I found in storage because the ones I found didn't match the ones on the tree. I felt so depressed. All of this after my mother begged me to spend Christmas day with them, saying it was important to spend this time together.

This year my sister is in town until the 17th so we did Christmas dinner on the 15th. Because of this, and last year, I'd like to spend Christmas eve and Christmas day with my boyfriend's family. My dad is still planning on cooking a roast beef for us on Christmas eve, but I just don't want to be there. It's depressing as hell.

So, AITA for spending both Christmas eve and Christmas day with my boyfriend's family? I told my mom but I don't think she fully understood what I was saying. I'm going to talk to her today and make sure she understands, at which point I'm concerned she's going to guilt trip me. My dad doesn't care. He's just happy I'm in town for 2 weeks.

Edit: I am staying at my parents' house for the 2 weeks that I am in town, so I have been seeing them and spending time with them every day. Also, when I referred to myself as a grinch, I meant that i felt that way internally. I have always made sure to put on a smile for my mom and not actually act like a grinch on Christmas.","~~YTA~~.  Tell your mom you dont need the decorations or presents.  Just go spend some time with them.  It will mean so much to them and you not coming home will break their hearts.

bg40or,"TLDR at the end.
I will explain this well enough so that you can understand this without being a horse person.

Some useful horse info to understand this better:

- When a horse breaks a leg it has to be euthanized.

- We usually ride around on the arena avoiding the person jumping when we have jumping lessons to keep the horses “warm” before our turn.

- A “green horse” is the same as an inexperienced horse.

- Most horses retire from competing at 18 yo.

Some background info:

At the stable I ride there is a woman [30] who recently bought horse [20]. She has only ridden for 6 months and rides terribly. The horse she bought is extremely jumpy and a very advanced horse. He has been abused in the past and he competed on an international level in dressage. Meaning he was an extremely good horse. I have worked with him on the ground (walking him and getting him used to his surroundings and grooming him, when he was scared). I cared a lot about this horse and I am devastated this happened.
The woman is known for riding in the way of others on jumping lessons. She would ride in front of a jump that another horse was going to jump it when it wasn’t her turn.

I [15 f] ride a quite green horse [7], that has trouble making turns. He has only just started to learn how to jump. The horse isn’t mine and I am training him for the riding school. I have ridden a lot of green horses and problem horses and I would like to say that I am very good for my age.

The accident

It happened during a jumping lesson when I was riding towards two jumps that only had one horse step in between them.
When I was about two steps away from the jump the woman I mentioned earlier, suddenly rode in between the jump. I had only a couple of seconds to decide what to do.
If I had tried to steer my horse to the side he would have definitely fallen over and possibly injured himself or in worst case scenario he would have not been able to make the turn and would have crashed into the side of the jump which was decorated with sharp stars (I shit you not).
If I continued riding forward I would either crash into the other horses hind legs and definitely break them or he would have time to ride past the jump. I chose the latter option and got unlucky.
My horse tends to stretch out a lot after jumps and because I was distracted I forgot to prepare for this. He stretched is front legs out and kicked the other horses hind legs with his front hooves and the other horses hind legs broke. He had to get euthanised.

Now when I think about it, I chose risking a horses life over definitely hurting my horse badly. There is a difference between being right and being an asshole. So reddit AITA?

TLDR: AITA for taking a risk and ending up breaking a horses legs when I could have chosen to badly injure my own horse instead, when the situation was created by the other party?

EDIT: Can you guys specify if it was the fact that I chose my self over her or some other reason that made me TA if you think I am so?

EDIT 2: Remember I made this decision in a split second.
- It was a lower level lesson that I was taking part in just to train this horse.
- I couldn’t have predicted that she would slow down in between the jumps to do a canter change.
-Everyone on the lesson knows we are the trouble equipage.","NTA

As you said, the horse you were riding wasn't yours, and you were responsible for its safety. It seems that this woman, who has little experience (and zero situational awareness from the sound of it), rode the animal *she* was responsible for into danger. That this wasn't her first time getting in someone's way doesn't reflect on you. She was in error. You may have made a small mistake, but I'm sure the owner of the inexperienced horse is grateful that you kept their young mount alive and intact.","NTA. I'm a horsewoman as well, although I'm not much of a jumper. It's basic horse sense - as well as common courtesy - to yield to whoever is actively heading towards a jump. She apparently has done this in the past and gotten lucky, and her luck just ran out this time. It's not your fault, *plus* a horse that green should automatically get right-of-way when going at any pace other than a walk. That's the rule at my stable, anyway.",0,0

e72pjr,"This happened a while back but I often think about it so figured id ask reddit about it. 

I used to live in a dorm on my university campus. The dorm is a tall and narrow building and the primary road access/parking for this building is a small 1 lane roundabout with about 5 or 6 car parking spots mainly for staff who work in the dorm. However there are 2 motorcycle spots which are clearly marked ""motorcycle parking"". One of which I pay to use as well.

One day I was riding back to my dorm after class and there is a car parked in the middle of the roundabout lane blocking off both the parking spots. So im behind the car and I know she notices  because my bike is fairly loud and im literally behind her. I assumed she would roll her car forward to let me in but after 2 minutes she wasnt moving so I wave to her and point to the parking to let her know im trying to get in. Still no response. So I honk at her and finally she moves and I can park. 

I shut off my bike and im about to walk into my dorm when the lady rolls her window down and starts yelling at me so I walk to her passenger side to see whats up. Her (what I assume) daughter is in the passenger seat, she looks like shes in highschool or something. The lady starts asking me why I honked at her and what the deal was. I motioned to my bike and told her that she was blocking my parking spot and wouldnt move. She says that I could have just rode around her car. She is driving a dodge caravan which is wide enough to cover the entire lane and even if I could go around im not comfortable enough to try and maneuver my bike all around her fat car to get into my spot. I explain this to her and she keeps yelling that I had no right to honk at her etc etc. Then her daughter joins in and ALSO starts yelling at me. So I ignore the daughter and just call the lady an asshole and walk into my dorm. 

Some of my friends thought I was the asshole for calling the lady an asshole in front of her daughter. What do you guys think, AITA?

Last Christmas we took a family ski vacation up north to Branäs. My oldest daughter, 20 years old, had her own cabin along with her boyfriend and they drove up in her car. We, wife, both younger daughters and myself, had our own cabin a few doors down. 

A major part of everyone’s Christmas gift was the trip itself, plus lift passes, ski rentals, food, and the cabin rentals.  Also gifts to open on Christmas. Several years ago we all decided to travel during the holidays instead of go nutz with objects.  
 
Skip forward to dinner, keeping in mind that while she and boyfriend had their own cabin they ate their meals, not snacks, with us and we bought all the food and I did most of the cooking, while my wife did the balance of the cooking when I didn’t. Earlier in the week she and boyfriend were at the local grocery and on her own decided we needed a couple thing added to Christmas dinner, bought them and brought them for me to prepare. Ok no problem. So while we’re eating dinner she decides to say to her mom than she needs the money back for the stuff she got for the dinner. I interrupted before my wife could reply with “really?” “we’re 6000 euros into the trip and you’re going to ask for 10 euros for something that only you and your boyfriend eat?” And with that came the trickle of tears. My wife tried to redirect to conversation and we moved on but she was butt hurt the next couple hours. Needless to say I felt like an ass but really I’m to the point of we both suck.

Last weekend I attended a bachelor weekend and on the second evening we spontaneously hired a stripper to give a lap dance to the groom. All the other guys, including me were just watching.

I had a discussion with my girlfriend before this weekend about strippers where she told me she wouldn't like it, doesn't approve of it. I always stated my opinion that I don't mind it, I wouldn't mind her watching a stripper with a bunch of friends. I don't see this as a sexual or erotic thing, but purely an entertaining moment to share with the bachelor group. She also wouldn't have a problem if we watched a stripper together...

So the weekend has passed and my girl asks me if there were strippers. I answered honestly and said yes and now she feels like I cheated on her. She puts strippers on the same page as hookers and I just don't see it that way. I never have the urge to go and see a stripper, I find it more weird or awkward than anything else, but I did enjoy it as an entertaining moment on a bachelor weekend.

So my girlfriend asked me to promise to never see a stripper again, but it just doesn't feel right to me as I don't agree on her views on this. AITA for watching a stripper while I knew she wouldn't like it and not wanting to promise to not do it again?","YTA you knew it made her uncomfortable and did it anyway. Arguing that a stripper isn't an erotic thing seems kind of ludicrous to me. I don't understand how a woman sexily dancing and taking off her clothes isn't erotic.

bozdg9,"I am an atheist who has a few very Christian friends. Awesome. I am very tolerant of their religion and we never have any issues with it. We normally do not talk about it but have mentioned things before without having any problems or arguments because they are also very tolerant people.

Anyways, my friends mention waiting to have sex until they are married somewhat often and although I think it is a horrible idea for various reasons, I have never said anything to them about it. I have nothing against the religion, just the premarital abstinence.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it is bad because sex is an important part of almost any relationship and waiting until marriage could be problematic...You could have a really bad wedding night because losing your virginity can be painful, not fun, etc. You could be a very bad match sexually, you could have bad chemistry, etc. All of those things could cause marital problems since sex is important in a relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I have never talked to any of them about these problems but I feel bad about it because I am their friend and I care about them. I would like to say these things but have decided not to because I am sure they would be uncomfortable, they may get mad at me, and it may not be my place. So, WIBTA if I kept quiet and didn't tell them my thoughts to myself about this? Or should I tell them what I think?

Last night my roommate requested that I no longer have at the house on weeknights due to high stress at work and the noise(noise levels are moderate, loud talking or maybe small outbursts i.e. getting a good dice roll or winning a game, not temper tantrums).

bczfnp,"A couple months ago, my sister offered me a little side job. Her friend, whom I'll call Abby, needed someone to dog-sit while she went out of town for a week. I have never dog-sat before, but I'm good with dogs and my sister said that the dog was fairly well-trained. And Abby offered decent pay. So I say yes. She leaves me keys to the house and instructions on how to take care of her dog, whom I'll call Bree.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's everything that goes wrong:

&amp;#x200B;

* Bree's a fairly big pup, a couple months old at best. She's extremely hyperactive and her nails were not trimmed down. Any time she jumps up on me, I get scratched. Hell, she drew blood a handful of times on the first night.
* She whines. A lot. It's obvious she's been pampered to hell. She whines to get attention and to get what she wants. The whining continues on for hours at a time, even when I play with her and give her attention. She was 'trained' to ring a bell when she needed to go to the bathroom. But she'd ring this bell all the time, moments after going to the bathroom even. Any time I wasn't giving her attention, she'd whine and ring this damn bell.
* Abby told me to let her sleep in the same room at night, since Bree would get lonely. But Bree would whine all night long. I tried everything I could think of, but this dog would whine for hours on end. I couldn't sleep. 
* When outside, she'd fake going to the bathroom and then run inside and poop upstairs. If I lost track of her for 10 seconds, she'd have disappeared upstairs to go poop.
* The heating was broken mid-winter, so it was constantly \~64 degrees. And the hot water heater wasn't working well.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried my damndest to be a good caretaker. This was the week before finals, so I needed to focus and study and write. But the whining made it near-impossible to focus. After three days, I told my sister that I couldn't stay. I promised to feed Bree, to let her out to the bathroom, to take her on a walk or two, and to play with her for 15 minutes or so per day. Honestly, I felt like I had been lied to about the whole situation, and I really needed to focus for finals.

dlzr79,"I went to very religious school growing up, for high school I decided to go to a public school, which offered a better education.

I've been openly agnostic from a very young age. Additionally I was told that everyone in the family going back years had gotten their entire education from religious institutions, and that it ""was perfect"" for them, general guilt tripping, attempts to make me understand why my agnostic views were ""wrong"" etc. all of which, I'm happy to say, I did my best to ignore. In sophomore year of high school, I came out to my parents as bi and by the end of the year, the entirety of side B came to know I was bi even though I wasn't openly out. Parent B, and side B overall, was furious and confused. At every opportunity, side B would badger and guilt trip me into discussing my sexuality at length and I felt trapped in these (incredibly homophobic) discussions for years. Multiple times these discussions would happen in public places, attract attention, and end up with them yelling, and me crying during or after. This pattern continued until my mental health (for unrelated reasons) took a sharp nose dive and I was hospitalized multiple times. Once I was hospitalized the first time, the discussions with side B turned back to my choice to go to a public high school and they claimed that as the ""only explanation"" why my mental health was that bad. Around the beginning of senior year I started to realize that I am actually trans and pan. On my most recent trip home to parent B for a family member's funeral, I was brought to a very unwanted discussion of my identity for the umpteenth time, intervention style, this time my grandparents outright refused to discuss anything else and began guilt tripping me referencing their concern for my health. During this discussion I kept a fairly level head until my grandfather specified that no one could believe that I was trans, but if I told them that I was ""just gay"", then that would ""make more sense"". My grandparents also insinuated that my gf of 2 years must be fetishizing my transness, since according to them no cis person would ever support someone transitioning for any other reason. I ended the discussion with ""agree to disagree"", and haven't spoken to them since. My gf thinks that I may be overreacting. She cut off every relative of hers due to constant mental and heavy drug abuse on their part and has said that her perspective may be a little warped because of her experience.

I asked for the same thing for Christmas and have asked for this every year on my bday and Christmas. I also ask that my parents both be there for random things, like when I had surgery or when I was hospitalized with the flu a few years ago. I'm a junior this year and scheduling college visits and want them both to be there for those as well.

My dad dated someone for two years but outside of that there has been no other serious relationship for either of them since the divorce. 

Yesterday I was talking to an uncle about a college visit we were planning and mentioned something about finding a weekend both my mom and dad were free and my uncle made a comment about me still doing the “happy family” nonsense and how I was old enough to let that go and I was kinda being a jerk by making my parents have to pretend for a day. He alluded to how painful the divorce was for them (I do not know why they divorced and although adultery was once mentioned in a conversation I wasn’t meant to overhear, I don’t know which of my parents they were talking about and don’t really want to know if they did)  I was taken aback as I never got the sense my parents were bothered by my request. I separately asked them about it later and they both said they were happy to do it for me and a couple times a year didn’t bother them.

i understand that you want your family to be happy together but the fact is, they're not. that's why your parents are no longer together. and if the divorce was difficult and messy, spending time together is going to be equally so. guaranteed they dread these days. 

IMO this is as selfish as it gets. expecting your parents to endure continued animosity for your sake just because it makes you feel nice. yes, there will be ties they will want to or have to be in the same room together, but this forcing of familial fakeness isn't fair to them one bit.

c7wp1g,"This will be probably one of the less interesting posts here, but just had a big disagreement with my wife over a minor incident and I’m seriously having some self doubts about my behavior.  To start, we’re staying ay an all inclusive resort in Ibiza.  I’ve been seriously dieting and very conscious about my calories and carbs and have been foregoing alcohol for the majority of the time and my wife is too somewhat.  

For the majority of time here, my go to drink has been club soda with some lemon or lime juice.  They dont seem to have any pre-squeezed, but its not been a problem for any of the bartenders, except one, to cut a lemon and hand squeeze it with one of their juicing contraptions.  The work involved is far less than preparing most mixed drinks I see being ordered like margaritas or mojitos.   However, this one guy has so far denied me this twice by suggesting orange juice or pineapple juice, which is already in a carton.  Each time I was confused as to why he couldn’t do it, but with the language barrier, I didn’t protest and just asked for a slice of lemon and moved on.  It was the 2nd time I realized he was just being lazy because a different bartender behind the same bar was able to squeeze a lemon for me on my next order.

Now today, my wife and I were off the resort exploring the island during the dat and returned back to the resort both thirsty and mentioning how we were looking forward to a tall club soda with lemon juice.  Sure enough, when we arrive at the bar, the one who takes our order is the guy who I know is going to refuse.  Nonetheless, I order as a usually do and he then suggests orange juice as if it was a question, same as the other two times.  My wife and I both reply, no lemon juice please to which he responds “no lemon juice.  orange juice”.  At this point I just lost it.  I did not raise my voice, but in a very nasty tone I said, “oh come on, theres a squeezer right there and its never a problem with any other bartender.”     Needless to say the mood immediately near us changed.  Other people near us noticed.  However, he didn’t say another word and proceeded to make the drinks.  My wife looks at me like I’m crazy and says, “whats wrong with you, he was probably just kidding”.  I tried to explain my past experiences where he refused and how I predicted he would refuse again, but apparently none of that mattered.  Honestly, if I was in the position to cut the lemon and squeeze it myself I simply would have, but I feel I pay a lot of money to be at the resort and I’m being held hostage to what this guys decides he wants to do or not do.  Perhaps I could have had more tact, and if I was Buddha I would have, but I’m not but does that make me TA?  I just want to know, AITA here for showing my annoyance?",ESH - your on vacation in the med and you let a lazy bartender get under your skin over a drink. Just speak with a manager and enjoy your vacation,"I'm going to go with YTA not so much for content, but for tone. The reaction of other patrons and your wife is quite telling.   


Also, I'm guessing this bartender specifically didn't speak English quite as well and figured you were asking for lemonade (you know, lemon juice), and not that a lemon be squeezed in a glass of soda - those are different things and the fact that he kept offering you different juices strongly indicates that.    


Some places also have strict policies regarding what may be offered/charged and the guy could be new and unwilling to jeopardise his position by adding something off menu to your tab. Also, you sound entitled as hell when you compare having a holiday in a resort in Ibiza to being held hostage to a poor bartender's whims. The guy wasn't rude, just not particularly compliant to your very specific demand and that is no reason to be nasty or try to shame him.   


You could have tried to get your point across again in a more polite manner, or maybe asked that another bartender explain what you wanted to him so you had no further problems during your stay. But congrats, you have now ensured a fraught relationship with your servers. Total asshole move.

buav78,"( I (20M) had been making this too long and I'm going to keep it simple for the sake of staying on point. If it needs extra info let me know. tl;dr at bottom )

After a bad long relationship, my mom has recently moved out of state (to OK) with my dog (now hers because I couldn't keep her at my current place) and she is coming back down to TX for a house party of her friends. She has asked for me to take a specific day off of work to come see her at said party so she can see me since she won't be in state for my birthday in June. I have that particular day off and had arranged for me to go to the party with her. 


Yesterday we were texting about her dog (previously mine) and the dog's recent, aggressive behavioural issues and then she asks if it's okay that she brings the dog with her to my house when she stays.


 Until this point she has not mentioned a single thing about staying at my home, let alone bringing the dog. I told her she cannot bring the dog due to my fiancee's job. 

My fiancee works for an extremely generous woman who allows us to live in a house on her property as long as my fiancee works for her. So we have rules such as not allowing certain dog breeds such as pit bull breeds of any kind (which my mothers dog is a pitbull mix), as well as asking permission for guests who stay overnight. 


So after I told my mother that the dog would not be able to be on the property whatsoever (per our contract w/ fiancee's boss) she complied, but when I also said I didnt know she was planning on staying with us, she replied with:  ""Well where am I suppose to stay...you are the only one there"". 

I then explained that she can't just blindly assume that she can stay with me for a few days without letting me (or my fiancee) know ahead of time she said: ""Wow...I would have never treated my mother like that"". 

I love my mother. But she and my fiancee don't have the best relationship. So I don't have the only say in letting her stay overnight (or whatever my mom was planning) especially when we have rules from my fiancee's ""boss"". 

AITA for telling my mom no? 

EDIT: Clairified genders.

TLDR; mom coming in from out of state for a party and planned to stay with me and my fiancee without asking us first.

After a bad long relationship, my mom has recently moved out of state (to OK) with my dog (now hers because I couldn't keep her at my current place) and she is coming back down to TX for a house party of her friends. She has asked for me to take a specific day off of work to come see her at said party so she can see me since she won't be in state for my birthday in June. I have that particular day off and had arranged for me to go to the party with her. 


Yesterday we were texting about her dog (previously mine) and the dog's recent, aggressive behavioural issues and then she asks if it's okay that she brings the dog with her to my house when she stays.


 Until this point she has not mentioned a single thing about staying at my home, let alone bringing the dog. I told her she cannot bring the dog due to my fiancee's job. 

My fiancee works for an extremely generous woman who allows us to live in a house on her property as long as my fiancee works for her. So we have rules such as not allowing certain dog breeds such as pit bull breeds of any kind (which my mothers dog is a pitbull mix), as well as asking permission for guests who stay overnight. 


So after I told my mother that the dog would not be able to be on the property whatsoever (per our contract w/ fiancee's boss) she complied, but when I also said I didnt know she was planning on staying with us, she replied with:  ""Well where am I suppose to stay...you are the only one there"". 

I then explained that she can't just blindly assume that she can stay with me for a few days without letting me (or my fiancee) know ahead of time she said: ""Wow...I would have never treated my mother like that"". 

I love my mother. But she and my fiancee don't have the best relationship. So I don't have the only say in letting her stay overnight (or whatever my mom was planning) especially when we have rules from my fiancee's ""boss"". 

AITA for telling my mom no? 


TLDR; mom coming in from out of state for a party and planned to stay with me and my fiancee without asking us first. We have certain contracted rules from our landlord/employer that restrict overnight guests, and my mother and my fiancee do not have the best relationship anyways. I told my mom she wouldnt be able to stay with us overnight. AITA??
