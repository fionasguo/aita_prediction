59jmqk,"**TL;DR I want to dye my hair some crazy colors. My boyfriend hates unnatural hair colors and while he says he'll love me regardless he thinks it looks trashy and he is gonna be bummed out if I dye it. I think I'm gonna do it anyway. Am I an asshole?**

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year and a half now. He's loving, caring blah blah blah. We have a great relationship with some minor conflict, but everything has been getting better (he grew up in a shitty household and this is his first real long term relationship, so he's kinda learning how a healthy relationship works). He's 25 and I'm 21.

When I go through periods of stress I usually get myself a big ""gift"", usually something that is a big change. I'm in college so generally this is once a semester. Last semester I got a cat, the semester before that I got a pet snake, the one before that I went platinum blonde and the one before that I dyed my hair red. For some reason it helps me cope with stress. 

So it's getting to that time again and I figured my ""gift"" this semester would be dying my hair some crazy colors. I've always wanted to do that and I feel like if I do it I need to do it soon since I probably won't be able to after graduation because I'll have a job (or at least be seeking one). I've been floating the idea past my boyfriend for a few months but yesterday I asked him in earnest to tell me what he thought. I sent a few pictures of styles I liked for his opinion and he confessed that he hated unnatural hair dyes, thought they looked trashy and that he really couldn't see himself liking any hair dye on me because he likes my natural color. 

I even tried photoshopping some different hair colors on a picture of me to see if that would change his mind (and because it was fun) but he still hated it. He told me I could do what I want, that he would still love me but that he prefers my natural hair and mentioned that if I had an appearance preference for him, he would do it. He told me he would still support me regardless and that it's my body to do what I want with, he was just gonna hate the way it looked.

Initially I figured I would just not dye it and that would be that, but I'm having a really hard time giving up on the idea and I feel like I'll regret it later if I don't go a little crazy now while I have the chance. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna just do it anyway but I feel shitty. I know if he wanted to do something like buzz his hair that I wouldn't like I'd be kinda disappointed too, I don't blame him at all for that. But does doing it anyway make me an asshole?","In short, no. 

If you're going through a stressful time and you think it will help you then go for it. Yes, he might not like dyed hair too much and even thinks it looks trashy, but he seems like he still very much supports your decision to do it regardless.

You're only young once, I say go for it! It's just hair, you can always change it.
","You're not the asshole. You can be in any sort of committed relationship and absolutely at no point should your partner be able to tell you what you can and cannot do. He can express his opinion, but you, as an adult woman with autonomy/control of your body, have the final say. 

He doesn't have to like your hair color to still love you. If he can't deal with it, it shows you now some glaring problems that likely would have come up later in the relationship. But overall, it's just hair that'll grow out and get re-dyed in no time anyway.

b0ymk0,"My friend and I were just on our way to breakfast, and I randomly asked her what animal rights were like in Korea. She then proceeded to tell me her grandad used to hunt to eat, survive. And I said, great, I completely get that. But what about nowadays? What do modern people think about hunting? And she got quite offended, like I was attacking her culture. She said that her friends and most people in Korea didn't really like talking about stuff like this and that it was a heavy subject. They usually talked about celebrities, and maybe they might talk about this kind of thing if it was trending on the news. She started to get really stressed out and started crying.

I get that maybe she didn't like talking about it, but for me, this kind of thing is important but has never been a heavy subject when I talked about it with others. It's like... a part of a person's values. But now I feel like I might have done something wrong? Or not? I literally can't figure it out.

cy266v,"**EDIT: Yeah, you guys are right, I'm just not going to reply to him. Good riddance.**

I'm not using a throwaway since I don't expect this to exactly incriminate me. 

I love wine. I love most types of alcohol, which is why I work as a bartender, but I especially love wine. A few months ago, I met a bunch of new people at a wine tasting for people ""in the business"" (for lack of better phrasing), joining them on a few after-works and becoming fast friends. I am significantly younger than most of them, by 7 or 8 years at least, but I really do enjoy hanging out with them. 

One of them, a guy I'll call Brendan, turned 29 a few days ago. I wasn't able to attend his actual celebration, but we made plans to have dinner at his place, have a few drinks, watch tv, and hang out with his beautiful, good good dog. 

I had a fairly expensive bottle of wine from my modestly sized collection: A Grace Family Cabernet Sauvignon, from 2013. These go for about 300-400 dollars, and there are only 600-700 cases made every year. There's also a waiting list, which is why I normally would never have gotten my hands on one: My brother in laws grandfather let me buy one from him at a discount as a graduation present when I was 18.

I figured that drinking wine is best to do with wine lovers, and brought it to cork open after dinner, and we finished it between us over episodes of WILTY. It tasted pretty fantastic.

I left at about 1 am, thinking that I had had a wonderful evening.

The next day, I got a text from Brendan, saying that whilst he appreciated the wine and enjoyed it, he thought that it was incredibly rude of me to drink from a bottle I gave to someone else, and that a gift wasn't meant to be shared with the giver. He said it was disingenuous of me, and that I was really just giving it to myself. 

I was taken aback by this, and have been kind of agonising over it these last few days, especially since we don't know each other very well and I really want them to like me. 

Was I the asshole?","NTA- if you guys split it in half, he got $150 worth of a present. And you had no obligation to GIVE him anything. Tell him he's an ass","NTA. I love whiskey. But rarely do I get to taste something in the 100+ tier because thats a lot of gofdamn money for some hooch.

e1vz1o,"My mother has always been a very protective person and has to be in control of everything. When I moved out six years ago she tried to manipulate me into doing her will nearly every time.

When my GF moved in with me she flipped. Calling my GF a golddigger, lazy, fat and told me what a disappointment I am for having a bachelor degree and not wanting to make a master. She even guild tripped me because I could not make it to a memorial for my grandma. I could not make it that day, because of some appointments and an hour ride I would have to make. Keep in mind, that she only tells me those things when we are alone, with company she tries to be the nicest person ever.

Now that my GF and I want to get married, she does not leave one chance unused to push my gf deeper in the dirt or to blackmail me. Those attempts are pretty various, telling my fiancee all the horrible things I did wrong when I was a child, take away my savings or to not give us one penny for the wedding (which no one asked for).

After one last chance to talk to her, she called my fiancee a golddigger, lazy and so on again. So I took a week to think about many things and I finally wrote her that she is not invited to the wedding.

e9edkf,"My next door neighbors are going out of town for the holiday season and want to know if they can drop their cat off with me. They’ll be gone about two weeks in another state, and can’t bring the cat with them. I love animals, and have a cat of my own who would love the company, so I enthusiastically agreed to the arrangement. However, apparently, their cat has a habit of getting into the toilet paper, and running all over their house with it in his mouth and ripping it up - basically just wasting their TP. To correct this, they want me to hit the cat with the cardboard part of a wire hanger whenever it shows interest in TP while at my house. They say it’s been working for them and thanks to this technique, he hasn’t gotten into the paper as much and they think they can break the habit if they keep it up. I do *not* want to do that. I’m not doing it. But I also don’t want to tell them I won’t do it, and have them go ask someone else in the neighborhood who *would* do it. They also do other minor nonos, like bathing the cat once a week, letting it outside when it’s not fixed, and feeding it dry food rather than wet which my vet tells me is better. WIBTA if I basically lied and told them I would do what they wanted, but instead just... not?

ETA: Commenters have told me dry food actually *isnt* all that bad for the cat, and changing his diet suddenly would make him sick. I thought most cats eat wet food, my mistake. I’ll leave his food be.

ETA 2: I’m not saying I’m going to change his whole routine. I’m willing to do everything the way they do, except hit the cat, and maybe not let him outside, because I would hate for him to get hurt on my watch.","NTA for everything except the dietary stuff.  It doesn't sound like they're great pet owners, but messing with an animal's diet out of nowhere is just asking for diarrhea.  Vets recommend a mixture of wet and dry food because the wet gives the cat a little extra hydration, but it's far from mandatory.  My cats eat exclusively dry food (for dental reasons) and they're fine.  Don't mess with the food.  But I'd say no, you don't have to hit the cat.  Just keep your bathroom door shut and it becomes a non issue - if they ask, you won't even have to lie.","I’m torn. 

Obviously don’t hit the cat. A can with some pennies in it given a good shake or a spritz with water is effective and not harmful. I don’t care who I’m pet sitting for—I’m not going to hit/abuse an animal and you shouldn’t either. But I would tell them that. “I don’t feel comfortable hitting but I can use these other proven deterrents”

I also think that letting the cat outside is a bad idea for a lot of reasons, but I think you should tell them that if they want you to pet sit, you’re not letting the cat out because it may not come back to you and you don’t want the liability of losing their cat. But you have to tell them this not just say you will and not do it.

As for the food, yep, you’re right. Studies have shown that most cats don’t get properly hydrated with dry kibble alone and are at an increased risk for UTIs and other urinary issues if that’s all that is available. But changing a pet’s diet abruptly comes with other risks and I don’t feel it’s your place to make this judgment call. 

I feel like YWBTA if you smile and nod and agree to all of this and do something completely different without their knowledge.

I’d decline to help if they insist you hit the cat or let it out. But this may be an opportunity to educate so I’d discuss.",3,3

ei4gyq,"Throwaway. 

I had a rough childhood. My parents were fine but I never had much friends and since I was in about 7th/8th grade, I just remember kind of always being unhappy. In my early years of high school I was always sad &amp; would cry myself to sleep some nights. As I got older &amp; got more freedoms, part-time jobs, money of my own etc, I got better but I was never truly a happy person. I had anxiety &amp; at times depression. 

I’m 20 now &amp; have been vegan for 1 year. I went vegan for several reasons, mostly ethical, environmental &amp; if I’m being perfectly honest - I never cared much for meat anyways &amp; I’m allergic to dairy so it wasn’t a tough time for me transitioning. My parents seemed reasonably supportive. 

I finally decided to pour out my feelings of sadness to my mother in the hopes she might help me seek therapy for my problems. She proceeded to tell me she thought as a vegan I was missing essential nutrients in my diet &amp; that’s why I was depressed. I asked her if she listened to a thing I said about being depressed since I was 13/14. She insisted I need to go to the doctor for a blood test. I dropped the subject &amp; said I was just feeling shitty about my exams at university &amp; I’d be fine after a good nights sleep. She said that sounds reasonable. This was 2 months ago. 

Last week I tried to broach the subject with her again &amp; once again she said veganism was the reason. I was missing essential nutrients in my diet from not eating meat. This time I got really angry with her. I asked her why she couldn’t listen to what I was saying. For how long I’ve just been constantly sad. Why she thinks get aism is causing my problems when, if anything, it has helped me feel better about myself as I learned to cook. I then told her if this is the only response she’ll I’ve me then I might as well pretend I’m happy &amp; never tell her about my problems. 

I ended up once again pretending everything was fine &amp; my mom went off to finish off Christmas things. This was a week ago &amp; I guess I’m just never going to be able to talk to my mom about what’s really wrong. Even if I went to the doctor to see what’s going on, it wouldn’t matter if he told me I was healthy or not, I’m still angry with my mom for not listening to me. Even if I was missing essential nutrients in my diet which I highly doubt because I eat fairly well, it doesn’t explain why I’ve felt so shitty about myself from ages 13-18. 

AITA for not trusting my mom with my feelings anymore? She’s actually usually such a great mom &amp; person, it makes me angrier &amp; sadder this is the way she reacted.","NTA - I'm sorry you've been so consistently dismissed and questioned. That said, as a fellow depressed vegan, you might want to check your B12 levels because a deficiency will worsen your symptoms a lot.","NTA - You told her twice, yet she still wants to blame your diet.

clx62w,"My car was shaking when I braked from high speeds, my dad told me it was the rotors and I believed him but the deal I got the car from has free diagnostic so I took it there. 

So my dad was right, it was the rotors. My friend had just done the brake pads like a month ago but not the rotors. So the dealer guy said it'll be 650 to get all four rotors shaved down and an oil change (synthetic oil so oil change is like 90 bucks itself). I said ok. 

He calls me like an hour later and says his guy started cutting the front rotors and it wasn't gonna work so they needed to replace all 4 four 850. I asked if they cut the backs ones yet and he said no. I specially said *do not* cut the backs ones ""do as little as possible"". 

He calls me again and says his guy cut a back rotor and it wasn't gonna work so I needed to replace those too as it was too uneven now. I said I told you not to cut those and he was like ""I was just tryna to help you out""


I'm fuming at this point, go to pick up my car. It's 750 for the two front rotors and the oil change (when they had quoted me 850 for all 4 and the oil change?!). I pay and leave. My car is literally not drivable  it's so shaky. I bring it back and tell him the car is dangerous at this point and it needs to be fixed.

I tell him I'll get a lawyer cause I'm not giving him literally another penny, I paid 750 for a car that's worse than before. 


I ask for the manager and eventually they agree that it was their fuck up and they'll eat the back rotors. Pick the car up the next day and it's good.

After complaining about installation costs and complaining about a shared neighbor of ours (who I have no problem with), they ask me if I want to go in on the fence.  I decline because I’m OK not having a fence but if they want one, go for it.

cnkhu1,"This happened about a couple of weeks ago, but the event has been playing non-stop in my head since then, so my memory of it is still very vivid. I will try to retell the story in a matter-of-fact manner, and let you guys be the judge.

About 2 weeks ago, I dropped by Subway to grab a quick lunch. It was extremely crowded, and all the people in line had to stand uncomfortably close to one another. Because of the proximity, I couldn't help taking notice of the man in front of me. Judging by his appearance, if I really had to guess, I would say that he was probably in his late 20s, perhaps early 30s. He looked well-groomed, and had a very fit physique -- it was obvious that he was someone who took good care of his health. He also looked like he spent a lot of time in the sun, judging by his conspicuous tan lines.

As I was letting my mind wander while waiting for my turn to place my order, I suddenly noticed that he had a few moles behind his right ear. One of them struck me as looking very abnormal -- it was asymmetrical, irregularly shaped, and seemed to have patches of dark brown and black. Even though I am not medically trained, I have seen enough pictures of melanoma to strongly suspect that he might be afflicted with skin cancer. He might not have noticed the unusual-looking ""mole"" himself, since it was located behind his ear. 

I was debating with myself whether to give him a word of caution. On the one hand, I did not want to come across as invasive and socially awkward; but on the other hand, if he was indeed ignorant of skin cancer risks, then he would probably appreciate knowing that he had at least one melanoma on his body. I began to imagine myself in his position -- if I were him, I would definitely want to know. Besides, as I said, he looked like someone who cared a lot about his health, so chances were even better that he would be grateful. I picked up my courage and tapped him on his shoulder.

Me: Excuse me.  
He: Yeah?  
Me: I don't mean to be rude, but... I noticed that there is a spot behind your ear that looks like a patch of skin cancer cells.  
He: What?  
Me: *(thinking that he didn't hear me correctly)* I noticed that...  
He: Are you a doctor?  
Me: No, but one of the moles on your ear highly resembles a melanoma. I have seen many pictures of melanomas, and I strongly suspect that you have skin cancer.   
He: Again, are you a doctor?  
Me: No, but, as I said...  
He: So no, you are not a doctor.  
Me: No.  
He: Well, since you are not a doctor by your own admission, you really should mind your own business instead of fear-mongering.

He then hastily turned around, clearly wanting to end the conversation. I was embarrassed, and, to be honest, annoyed that my good intentions were punished with chastisement. I later told a friend about what happened, and she called me an asshole for being presumptuous.

4r0hp3,"So, I just asked a friend of mine if she would like to attend a concert with me, and her boyfriend called me immediately from her number and bitched at me, asking me if I had no boundaries.

I have every intention of keeping the friendship platonic. Although I understand that he does not know that. I also realize its reasonable for him to assume that I did have ulterior motives.

Did I cross a line? Was it not okay for me to ask a friend to go to a concert with me?

Edit: spelling
","This seems like a situation where a lot more background info is probably needed, but based off this alone youre definitely not an asshole. If you have been friends with this girl for a while, or have been absolutely friendly and nothing more since you've known her, then the boyfriend needs to chill, as she is of course allowed to have male friends.","I agree with people in that you're not the asshole in this situation. You are allowed to have friends, she's allowed to have friends. Friends hang out.

I think her boyfriend's frustration is unwarranted, misdirected and, in a sense, shouldn't be happening. But I also think we can understand why he might be slightly bothered by a dude that he doesn't know asking to hang out with his girlfriend. I don't think that makes him protective or overbearing or possessive, it's just an odd situation. Him calling you up was unacceptable though and crossed into that protective/possessive territory, there are better ways.

I've made it a habit of involving my friends' significant others as often as I can when I want to hang out with someone, whether it's a man or woman. I like being supportive of good, healthy relationships and hanging out with the couple as a couple is one way of seeing if it's good and healthy. Plus, I don't like putting someone in a position of having to ask ""is my SO invited?"" Of course I want them along! This also makes it completely clear to all parties that there are no other motives.

I would say start inviting your friends' significant others. Your friends will appreciate it, the SO's will appreciate it, and you'll probably have more fun because there's more people!",3,0
dnvqfn,"Gave my husband a time out

Sorry for typos and grammar and formatting, on mobile. 

So my husband is sitting at the table with our 2.5 yr old and they’re eating grilled cheese together as I was tidying up the kitchen. Our son wasn’t eating his food anymore and pulling the sandwiches apart (as a toddler does) and my husband wasn’t impressed.  

Now I’m not sure why, maybe he did it to be funny or teach him a lesson I’m not sure, but my husband pushed our sons face into the ketchup on his plate. Now our son is obviously upset and has ketchup up both nostrils and all over his mouth and starts crying (duh!).

My gut reaction was to say (in a stern voice) (sons name!) because sometimes we mix up the names, my husband said “no no he didn’t do anything, it was me” and I said “I know.. it was an accident I meant to say YOUR name”... so then I say “daddy, that was not very nice and you need to have a time out” my husband looks at me like I’m ducked in the head but I look at him and say “please go, we’re teaching him bad behaviour is met with a timeout”.

When he came back I said “can you please say sorry to mikey for pushing his face in the ketchup?”. 

Now my husband is pissed because he says he’s an adult and he shouldn’t be humiliated like that. I disagree because we’re teaching out son that bad behaviour is met with a time out. So reddit AITA? 

I see his point of view... we are the parent and he is the child... but like he did something mean to our son? I dunno...

Edit: My husband says he only “tapped” our sons face as he was licking the plate. He didn’t SHOVE his head from an upright position into the plate, if that matters.","Your husband did an *abusive* thing to your child and you're under reacting to it. Youre suggesting to your child that this is everyday bad behavior that people engage in sometimes and need to get punished for when you should be instilling in him that it's NEVER okay for an adult to touch him like that, that he needs to come to you immediately if anyone ever does, and that you'll protect him from adults who try to hurt him. This is beyond bad behavior, your husband needs therapy and you should be looking for other BRIGHT RED flags like this one. I could not look at a partner the same if they did that to our child.","ESH you guys are supposed to be a united front, always. You have just shown your kid that their dad is not an authority figure in the house, and that you can possibly be played off of each other. I like the apologizing bit, though.

There were 6 photos of her (or so I thought).  5 were by herself and the last was her and another guy.  We chatted it up and I added her on snapchat.  She had no bitmoji.  The day before our date I recieved a headshot of a guy and I was like oh is your brother snapping for you, and he said no this is me haha.  I thought it was a joke, but he said he accidently set his gender to female instead of male and was actually gay.

I had spent a week constantly talking to whom I thought was a girl but was really a gay guy.  I told him he fucking sucked, and that he was a fucking liar.  I was angrily and told him just because hes gay doesnt mean he can trick people like that.  He said it was a honest mistake.

dzcpyx,"Kids are 8, 11 and 13.

This weekend my father in law came over to visit us, I don't have any issues with him as a person but lately some of his opinions have been bugging me. Whenever he sees his grandkids his main advice for them is ""enjoying life comes first, work comes second"". He says this because according to him, he made too many sacrifices for his job only to realize none of it was worth it in the end. I get what he's trying to say but at the same time I don't think this is a good message to send to a bunch of kids/teenagers for various reasons. The main one being that nowadays it's unrealistic to have this mindset. And I especially didn't want my kids hearing it. So once he left I told the kids to ignore the stuff he had said because it was nonsense. 

Yesterday I got home and my wife was PISSED. She heard our 13 year old telling a friend what I had said and she did not like it at all. She said that I had gone behind her back and taught our kids to be dismissive of her father and also of his experiences, just like I was being. I told her this wasn't the case and explained my reasoning behind it but she only got angrier. I told her that I had as much as a say in our kids' education as she had and her response to that was that I should teach them something better than being assholes. We're not exactly on speaking terms at the moment, unless the kids are present. She also said that it's my duty to fix what I did but I don't believe I did something wrong other than using the wrong words to express myself.",[deleted],"YTA, firstly, how exactly is that bad life advice?

au0681,"Throwaway for obvious reasons

Okay so I'll give some necessary background information, I'll put an TL;DR at the bottom.

One of my friends is really rich, and the first of us to get married. We'll call her Mia from now on. In our friend group we have 'karen', now Karen has always been a bit defensive and hostile towards Mia. Not enough to have Mia notice this but enough for me to notice.

Mia never made a big deal about being rich, whenever we planned a girls night we would have dinner as places all of us could afford, but she would always cover us if needed. Her gifts for us were always personal, and it took Karen at least a year being in our friend group to discover Mia is rich.

Now upon hearing about Mia's engagement it came to no ones surprise that we would be her bridesmaids. Now I have to say I've known Mia the since high-school so I know that she has been low-key planning her wedding for years. So Mia is going all out, it will be a themed destination wedding. Now before anyone says anything about it being a destination wedding she will pay for anyone's travel expenses, she will also pay for all our custom made dresses.

Now here is the issue were I could the potential a-hole. Karen is one of the bridesmaids and I've heard through some other friends, that aren't invited to the ceremony, they are for the reception that takes place at a later date in our country so more people are able to attend. That Karen is badmouthing Mia to a lot of other friends, saying how she is unreasonable, spoiled and a b-word for wanting her dream wedding apparently. Now Mia has no idea yet, and might throw Karen out of the bridal party if she knows, Mia may be sweet but has a low tolerance for people who are nasty behind her back.

Now of course I don't want Karen to act like this to Mia, I'm not even sure why she is in our close friend group. Although I am not sure if it is my place to tell Mia about this.

So WIBTA if I tell Mia about Karen's behaviour and might get her kicked out of the bridal party.

TL;DR my friend is getting married and generous enough to pay for everything, another bridesmaid is being nasty behind her back and now I want to reveal the truth about her and might get her kicked out of the bridal party.

Edit: I'll talk to Karen first we are all going for drinks later so I get the chance to talk to her. You guys might be right it could indeed be a misunderstanding. I'll keep you guys updated on how it goes.

Update: okay so I made this post a few hours before seeing either Mia or Karen. Now I have a conclusion for the people who are interested. First off Mia knows, no I wasn't the one who told her. It was her fiancé, so apparently Karen uses her Snapchat as her personal diary and put a whole rant about Mia in her story forgetting that Mia's fiancé is friends with her on snap chat, maybe because he never sends her snaps.

So I went to the maid of honours house for girls night, where I find a crying Mia on the couch. You might ask what happened so let me tell you. Apparently Mia's question to Karen about which shade of blue she would prefer set Karen off so badly she went on a whole rant about Mia on her Snapchat story, saying about how awful she is, how the only reason she stays friends is because of a free vacation and all sorts of nasty stuff. Mia's fiancé sees this and tells Mia immediately, because who could blame him, this happened not even that long ago after I made this post. Well the Snapchat story was made in the afternoon the fiancé just saw it in the evening.

Now me, the maid of honour and the other bridesmaids were all hearing Mia out and comforting her, before Karen shows up. Now the maid of honour went off on her, which I can understand being Mia's best friend and discovering how Mia is being used. Karen now being full on thrown out of our friend group, sees this moment as an opportunity to tell us all off. Blaming Mia's fiancé and saying how he had no right to share this, because that's why you posted in on Snapchat I really don't see Karens logic in this but okay.

Now the truth is out in the open, I was fully prepared to talk to Karen first because it could have been a misunderstanding. But I didn't even got the chance to, thanks to everyone telling me to talk to Karen to make sure it weren't just nasty rumours, even though it wasn't necessary in the end I still appreciate it. ","NTA.  Mia is allowed to be rich, allowed to have her wedding wherever and however she pleases.  Covering expenses is incredibly generous.  Fuck Karen.

asz2dg,"First time posting on this sub, but this has been a point of contention between my sister and I and need some advice. I am getting married early April and we are all traveling down to the Caribbean for the ceremony (destination wedding). We originally gave my sister a plus one because we enjoyed her old boyfriend. Once they broke up, we decided to wait and see who she would be bringing.

Lo and behold she meets a new guy who NOBODY in my immediate family enjoys. He is unemployed (at 31), seems to mooch off my sister, and does not stop talking! Seriously, you cannot get a word off without this guy barreling through the conversation.

Regardless, I have decided that I no longer want him at the wedding. I know that it’s last minute, but we were able to get my cousin to fill in for him so that no money would be lost. My sister is now threatening to no longer come to the wedding since she feels like he should be coming with her (they’ve been going out for roughly 6 months).

Am I in the wrong here? I truly believe that I should enjoy everyone that’s coming to my wedding, especially since we designed it to me an intimate setting with only our closest friends and family. 

TLDR: I rescinded the plus one I gave to my sister and no longer want her boyfriend going to my wedding. She is pushing back saying she won’t go if he’s not included, they’ve only been going out 6 months.","YTA. Unpopular opinion so far but whatever.

It doesn't sound like the guy is violent or a criminal. I would agree with you if you were worried he would cause a fight  or scene, steal, etc etc, while there. But it doesn't sound like there is a chance he will ruin your wedding, you just don't like him.  Is it worth the relationship with your sister? 6 months is a decent amount of time of dating, it's not like one month.

etxnur,"Starting in the middle of it, I was kicked and blocked from a group chat I've been in for 6 months after saying to someone that ""you're lucky to have friends"" when he complains about feeling lonely due to his conditions with cancer. He explains that his hospital visits over a span of a year restrict him from communicating to his friends, including everyone in this group chat, as well as insult to injury he has a history of bad relationships with his family members. However, even in the group chat, he barely told anyone that he had cancer, yet alone that he feels lonely, and kept to only 3-4 people.

I've only heard that he got cancer after someone who knew about it brought it up, before quickly deleting the message, and I didn't take much note of it (after all it's clear that they don't want anyone else to read it). His condition and how lonely he felt or how it's acting up were all kept secret from me. Instead, he posts pictures of the hospital whilst saying all over in the group chat about how the nurses know his name due to how frequent his hospital visits were and how kind they were. This often sparked more conversations than me talking to anyone in the chat, and the more he kept even mentioning it the more I get irritated that I think that he's doing all of this for attention, with the perfect excuse that he has this 'condition'.

The group chat was open to talking about personal problems. It felt extremely comforting to have a place to talk about problems I was going through, including theirs which I still respectfully listen to, and the members invited me to share them. As a result I was given privileges to be in their 'inner circle'. But even in their circle, they barely talk about the person's cancer or his condition, and if they do they describe his 'condition' so vaguely that I was confused on what his 'condition' was. In addition, the treatment to him sharing his problems (most likely because he has cancer) was more attentive and compassionate than problems I had with loneliness and fear of missing out within the group itself. That irritated me.

So then he complains about how lonely it feels going to hospital and all that stuff. I snapped. ""At least you're lucky to have friends that care about you"". 100 messages about how much of an insensitive asshole I am, and kicked. For two months I felt extremely depressed, but of course I can't apologise or say anything. Blocked on this, ignored messages, all that. The rest of this single conversation spread all over the group chat, and the blocking and silence continued.

To this day, I would've still felt guilty about this, but the more I think of it, it pisses me off. They call me an insensitive asshole for not understanding and being sympathetic to the state and effect of his condition, when he kept it secret from many people, including me being in their 'inner circle', and only dropped hints about how great or terrible he felt being in hospital.

cu9fnz,"A while ago a coworker and I started talking and things started got personal and we had a moment of sharing about our parents getting sick and how her mom might pass and how my dad passed recently. At first I shared my number with her just to check up on each other and make sure we were both okay. We had a few conversations over text and in person at work where it was almost therapeutic just sharing with each other. This all started very innocently and it wasn't my intention to have it turn into anything else. But somewhere along the way I realized that we have things in common and that I might be developing feelings for her. 

She has shared with me before that she wasn't able to have these types of conversations with her boyfriend and that he wasn't good at being supportive. For example she wanted to dye her hair and where I said I think it'll look good, her boyfriend told her it's going to ""look stupid"". 

The other day she told me that her boyfriend went through our conversations and got upset that she was talking to me about things he felt like she should be talking to him about. I didn't really know what to say to that but the way she described it made me feel like it was kind of a breach of not just her privacy but also mine. She also told me she couldn't do it anymore and was done with it. Since we were at work that conversation didn't really go anywhere as we both got busy.

ebv5n3,"tl;dr: My brother, a lawyer who lives in an international Asian city, won’t stop wearing kilts on a casual basis. Our family hates it. We are not scottish. 

About 2-3 years ago he and his wife got hooked on Outlander; a TV show set in the Middle Ages in Scotland. They thought it would be funny to order kilts and wear them, but my brother took a liking to his, bought more and has been wearing them almost anytime he’s not at work. What this means is that in every picture we see of him and his family, he’s wearing this (IMO) ridiculous kilt in a sad attempt to be edgy and ‘zany’. Just FYI, he doesn’t look good in it.  He looks like a person with mental problems. 

He gets stared at all over town where he lives, and my own friends think it’s bizarre. I’m concerned it’s going to affect his life professionally (his coworkers/bosses would probably not approve if they saw him in these outfits) and it will affect the lives of his children (who are 1-5 years old) who will be in the ‘eccentric’ family. 

I’ve checked with some close friends in the city I live in, they think it’s a stupid and possibly career-dangerous idea.

She's been dating Cameron for about a year, a guy who I know independently of Trisha because he and I are both performers in the same local scene.

Cameron and I were originally good friends, but 3 years ago I drastically reduced contact with him after some complaints arose about his behavior toward other female performers in the scene. He caught some flack for using gendered insults and doubled down instead of apologizing when called out for misogyny. It caused a LOT of drama and Cameron was essentially blacklisted from the scene; bringing up his name will still upset a lot of people around here. Because of this, I now only see him rarely and only in the context of hanging out with Trisha.

My friend Margaret is also invited to my wedding, and is the only person on the guest list from the scene. She told me  that she was uncomfortable being at an event with Cameron, to the degree that she asked if I could make sure they were not seated near each other. She's usually VERY easy-going so I know this is a big deal for her or she wouldn't mention it.

7p2va5,"Quick recap. Dad wasn't greatest dad, but still pretty good. The older I got the more I hated going to his house. One day I was actually happy to be there and said something I thought would make him happy. 

He didn't appreciate it. Started yelling at me, right into my face. And told me to leave. So I did. That was a little under 4 years ago now. He's attempted to get into contact me with. I want nothing to do with him anymore.

Now my dad's side of the family wants to see me, and I have no problem with that, because I really do miss all of them. But I know, that they think I should forgive him. Which is something I'm not even going to consider. 

They've asked to see me a couple times. And both times now I've said no. Because I know seeing them, means my dad is going to show up. Because to my dad, he did nothing wrong, and thinks he can repair this. He's the type of guy to use others to try to get to me. As in my grandparents, my uncle, my apparently ""very sick"" grandma, who when we went over go see her, she wasn't even home, and he was there. 

He also used my little step sister and brothers, claiming they missed me. The oldest one was 4 when I left. When I saw her recently (like 2 years ago now) she didn't seem to recognize me. 

He also messaged my uncle on my birthday saying ""all your cousins wanna see you on your birthday, can we please see you?"" 

""We"" ....which means he's going to be there.

And I love that entire side of the family, but the 2 times I did talk to them, all I got was how I should forgive him, and how I should be able to look past it. I know seeing them means talking about my dad, which I don't want.

So my main question, AITA for keeping away from that side of the family?



Edit: just thought I'd throw this in here about my dad. A couple months ago he messaged my uncle, trying to get in contact claiming my grandma was sick. He worded it to make it sound like she might die. 

So I went to my grandma's to see her. She wasn't there, instead he was there alone. She had gone out for the day with one of my aunt's. While apparently ""very sick"". While there with my dad he told me about what has happened in his life recently. 

Now please bare with me, because as I'm typing this out, it honestly doesn't sound like something someone would say.

He told me about how he got in a huge fight with his ex-wife (my step-mom) and even burned down the house they were. (He had a braggy tone while telling me this) he told me about how he now has supervised visits with his other kids.

 How in court while they were trying to prosecute him for burning down the house , they were ""wrong for trying to blame me, they thought they could make the charges stick"" 

He told me this right after bragging about burning down his house and ""going crazy and losing it"" (his words)

Just thought I'd tell you guys this so you have a little more information about why I don't want to see him.

EDIT EDIT: Another fun story, for my 14th birthday I asked for one gift from him, a party with all my family. That was all I wanted and I asked him for that for my birthday gift.

The day before my birthday my mom drops me off at my uncle's house where he was, and when I asked him ""so is the party tomorrow?"" He said no.

Instead, he told all my little cousins, we were going to chuck e. Cheese on my birthday. To celebrate my birthday.

So on my birthday, I spent it at Chuck e cheese with a bunch of little kids. My dad claimed they ""came to celebrate your Birthday"" they didn't even know it was my birthday.

Icing on the cake? My step-mom texted me, saying to look happier, because my dad told her I didn't look happy. 



EDIT EDIT EDIT: one last thing, one weekend I was at his place, and on that Sunday my friend had his birthday party. So I asked my dad on the Sunday if I could go to my friends birthday party. He started yelling at my face about how my mom gets me all week and how he only see me during the weekend, and how this is his time, and I can't go because it's his time. And after yelling at me, he went to sleep. I didn't even talk to him the rest of that day because he just slept all of it. IIRC I was 12 during this. ","&gt;said something I thought would make him happy. 

Which was what, exactly? I feel like that's kind of an important detail.

I am a little naturally resistant to dating and I wasn’t particularly attentive to his texts. But I always responded, apologized when my response was delayed, and to be fair for going on 2 dates he was a little overzealous with the texting.

So I invite him over, he gets here at 930, and we watch a show and have a couple glasses of wine. We made out, he told me he really liked me, and I invited him to stay over.

So he did, we slept together and it wasn’t.. great.. he lost his erection pretty quickly and I asked what was wrong and he said nothing but seemed embarrassed. So I was like all good, went to sleep, and when we woke up I asked again if everything was ok. He said no, left and said see you soon! I should mention that I have an ED so my body is whatever the opposite of voluptuous is. My mind immediately went to shit he’s disgusted by my body. So I text him and say “hey, I’m feeling a little weird about last night. Is everything ok? If you aren’t feeling this we can end things here if you want” he responds, “I’m not feeling it, we should end things” 

I texted him back with the following message: “Ok, to wrap things up, I do just want to be clear on what changed last night. I was ambivalent about going on dates and I mentioned above ^ that dating is hard for me right now. I’m feeling a little bit used because you pushed to come over, I invited you to stay over, you said that you liked me, we had sex, I asked you multiple times if something was wrong and you clearly said no, and now you aren’t feeling it. I just want to clarify if it was something I did or said or if I’m just not attractive to you? I can handle the truth but it feels really icky and I feel used and, out of respect, I just want resolution from the situation. I am fine with whatever the reason is, because I definitely wasn’t sure that these dates were going anywhere, but having sex and ending it so abruptly can be really damaging to a person without communication.” 

Am i being super psycho and an asshole, or am I justified in feeling used in thinking he’s a total asshole?

Edit/ Update: So he did respond! He was kind about everything and wrote “Again I’m sorry for last night and not communicating how I felt. That was not fare to you. I was also unsure about the dates we had and if it would go anywhere. I am not as attractive to you as much as I was hoping for. The sex ended prematurely because of the position I was in with my wrist and when I wear a condom I usually need oral before I put the condom on. Those were things I should have said or ask for. I have a hard time expressing how I feel in the moment, it’s something I know I need to work on. I honestly think you are an amazing person and wish you the best. I hope this helps” 

To be honest, I think that was more than fair and I definitely feel relieved that it ended for those reasons, rather than feeling like someone used me to get in my pants. I appreciate all the feedback on this cause I did feel a little crazy asking for a reason, I’ve just never been in a dating situation that had such poor communication and it did my head in when it ended like that. I am grateful that we didn’t continue to date just because we had sex and were on the same page about the actual relationship. Wasn’t going anywhere and in retrospect, I should follow my gut a little more if I find myself resistant/reluctant to dates BEFORE sleeping with a guy and setting better boundaries— that might make me the asshole to begin with. Also, 29 and mixing up fare and fair? Dealbreaker as it is. /s Anyways thanks for the support and input!!","NTA i think what’s probably happened is the guy got nervous got into his own head, it happens especially when you’re inexperienced, lost his erection and felt to embarrassed to tell you the truth. I wouldn’t worry about it on your end.","NTA. He said he liked you then bailed after things got sexual. I'd want an explanation too.

cyqrbp,"To start off, I am 24 years old man. My Tinder profile explicitly tells that I'm looking for long time serious relationships (that's quite normal at where I live).

&amp;#x200B;

2 months ago I met this 21 years old girl (let's call her Anna) who felt like the most trustworthy girl ever. You know the feeling when you instantly click with someone? Well we got that. However she said that she doesn't want to rush into relationship, which seemed perfectly OK. After all we knew each other for only 1 month at that point. Basically we talked almost 24/7, except when me or her were seeing our friends.

&amp;#x200B;

She was talking a lot about our future and seriously gave the feeling that she was interested in long term relationship. However, every time she was seeing her ""friends"", I had a small bad feeling that they're not just friends since she literally moved here 6 months ago. But I didn't talk to her about this, since after all we were not exclusive.

&amp;#x200B;

However 1 week ago, I started to talk that I'm getting super tired of Tinder, and would like to make things exclusive, at least for a month or so to see how it works for us. She started to act strange and basically said that she would like to continue same way as we have done so far. I felt that maybe I should just start dating again, but keep her as a friend for a while to see where it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

Last friday I was out with my friends, updated my Tinder profile and arranged couple dates for next week and she was out with her only friend (let's call her Sophia) that I really knew to be a real long term friend and a woman. 

&amp;#x200B;

At one point during the evening, Anna sent me a message that she most likely fucked up her friendship with Sophia. 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked what's wrong and Anna told me that the reason why she didn't want to make things exclusive was that she was seeing an another man who fulfilled some fetishes that she had (and never told me about them) At this point I was seriously wondering why the fuck would she tell me this.

&amp;#x200B;

We arranged a meeting for next day, where she basically tried to reason with me. The reason she told me, was that she was ready to go exclusive and felt that being completely honest was only way to regain my trust. She told me the guys name, where they met. He's 42 years old (Let's call him Dan) that she met in her hobby like +5 years ago. Then I asked why did Sophia get angry about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Dan has been in serious relationship for 9 months now. Sophia apparently doesn't like that at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't have a relationship with someone who doesn't see what's wrong in enabling an affair for that long time.

&amp;#x200B;

However on Annas defence, she didn't really cheat on me. We didn't have anything exlusive going on. On the other hand I feel that I wasted 2 months of my life to get blatantly misled.

&amp;#x200B;

So Reddit: WIBTA if I digged up Dans GF and told her what Dan is doing with Anna?","ESH

You are all a bunch of weirdos who don't want to be ""exclusive"" while trying to be exclusive. And then when someone sees someone else while not ""exclusive"" its always a problem. Get your shit together.","YWBTA it's none of your business and your don't know what Dan's relationship arrangement is. You're also not in a relationship with Anna.

bfon1q," A bit of backstory: I was diagnosed with autism at age 11, and my parents still expect me to be normal, and follow all of the unwritten rules of our society, which has lead to a lot of horrible scenarios which brings us today, where I don't want anything to do with my family due to the lack of emotional support and understanding (not to mention how infantile they act when things don't go their way).

So my parents recently got back from a trip to Europe, and upon their return they guilted me for not seeming very happy to see them return (i really wasn't). I told them that I am in fact happy to see them, I just don't show it very well. I lied obviously as I can't stand them, and they totally bought it. 

I'd like to mention that although they have the worst personalites and parenting techniques, my parents provide me with a weekly allowance, etc.

(i'm sorry if this doesn't belong here, this is my first time posting)","I'm Autistic too, and here's my POV:

**YTA.** mainly, for using autism as a scape goat for your problems and dislike for people.

You can't expect your parents to be unhappy because you are. Life goes on. If you don't like them, move out. I don't live with my parents, and they still try their hardest to support me. But you mentioned that you live with them, and they pay you to do so. If you don't appreciate that now, life only gets harder the older you get. Adapting to the world is something that we all have to do, Autistic or not. Those rules of society aren't that bad or hard. You'll have to support yourself one day, might as well adapt when you can. While you have their support as they're alive.",INFO: how old are you now?,0,0
ab1abo,"So, don't really know where to start. My girlfriend got pregnant 2 months ago, told me about it it about 5 weeks back, and she is keeping it. I don't want to be a father. I don't want any more of my genes in the world, I don't want to pay for a kid, don't want to put shit on hold to support a family, so I bailed. 

I blocked her on everything, packed my shit and found the cheapest, shittiest apartment I could find, just to get away from her and the kid she's carrying... I've been living on my own for about 3 weeks now, spent a good 2 weeks thinking it over, and I can't and don't have the right to convince her to have an abortion, so I bailed. Honestly, I'm thinking of quitting my job and skipping town, so she can't get me for child support when the kid is born.

I feel so fucking split. She was really nice, and had this never happened, I could see myself spending a good few years with her, but no way that I'm dealing with a kid. I'm 23, waaaay too young to put everything on hold for the next 20 or so years, and I guess I looked out for myself.

e00094,"I worked in a tight knit pharmacy for a big Midwest chain store for 3 years. I got along with everyone. People actually liked working with me for some reason. For my last year there I had to cut back to part time because I was finishing my masters. My last day of work was a Saturday and I had been telling everyone 'this is my last month', 'this is my last week', 'last time I'll see our weekly stats'. So that Saturday comes around I show up to work as usual and it's just another day. The openers go to leave, see you tomorrow, and I say 'nope, last day I'll see you never.' They all just kind of stare at me; bewildered. 'I didn't know that', 'When did this happen?'. Even the pharmacist didn't know. The rest of that day I was so depressed I hid in the bathroom every half hour because I was in tears. I waited until the end of the day to 'pass judgement' and no one came around to say goodbye. There wasn't even a card. When I got home I decided that I wouldn't talk to them after that because they made it clear that I wasn't even significant enough to remember to put together a goodbye card.

A week after that the head pharmacist asked me to come in because they wanted to give me something. I straight up told her that pharmacy makes me feel sick because they all forgot about me and my last day and I didn't want to go back for anything.

To add to this, there's a total of 10 people that work there. Everytime an employee passed through, even the interns that were there for a week, they at least put together a card. So I personally felt insulted when one of the pharmacists who's there full-time forgot about my last day.

EDIT: to be clear, what the pharmacist wanted to give me was the copy of my license they kept on the wall, not a gift.

EDIT: Jesus I didn't think people would care at all. Let me clarify some things: we regularly hung out after work before I went for my masters. They regularly said I was a close friend outside of work. I worked my ass off every minute I was there. And I get it, me crying in the stalls is childish, but I felt heartbroken for being forgotten after three years. I couldn't help it. They just happened. But I kept hiding because I didn't want to cry in front of customers or my coworkers. And again, there was never a gift, they just wanted to give me a copy of my license that they had. I reduced my hours over the course of a year. My expectation for my last day was a farewell. No party, no potluck.

aqsdd8,"TL;DR my brother believes there should be a religiously enforced quiet time between the hours of 8pm and 6am, including no talking anywhere in the house. I don't agree.

So my brother and I (23 and 25 respectively) live with our parents - I'm disabled and can't afford rent if I moved out, but help out around the house to compensate, and we have a roommate - a friend of mine - who pays rent and helps out around the house (pet sits, takes care of dishes, cleans up kitchen). 

My brother, who doesn't pay rent, and who begrudgingly takes out the trash once a week if you remind him to, works fulltime as a banker, and he goes into work around 7am, waking up around 6am. Ever since he got this job, he's decided he needs to be in bed by 8pm every night, sunday through friday, with the sole exception being saturday, when he'll stay up until 2am playing games with friends online. 

I wouldn't have any issues with this, except he expects everyone in the household to be quiet after 8pm so he can fall asleep without being disturbed. I'll be out in the living room watching tv, maybe talking to my roommate, and get a text from him asking me to keep it down because he's trying to sleep. So I'll turn the volume down on the tv (until I can barely understand what people are saying) and if I'm chatting with my roommate, we'll turn to not-quite-whispering levels of quiet conversation. This isn't enough for my brother. If he is trying to sleep, any media not restricted to headphones, or any conversation, is apparently far too much, and if you talk after his designated bedtime, he sends constant text messages nagging you to be quiet.

Tonight, I'm celebrating Valentine's Day with my roommate - basically just hanging out, drinking a bit of wine, eating cheese and berries and chocolate, having a nice relaxed time in lieu of any partners or romantic plans. At 9, I got the standard message; ""can you keep it down? I'm trying to sleep!"" So I reply affirmatively, and my roommate and I turn down the volume, but continue to talk and hang out, not ready to wind down for the night. Next thing I know, my mom calls me to let me know she just got off the phone with my brother, who was complaining that we were making too much noise. I had to go to her room and explain we were being quiet, but didn't intend to go to bed just yet as it was not yet 10pm on Valentine's Day and we had a right to enjoy the holiday outside of his self-designated socializing hours. My Mom agreed but advised we just ""try to be quieter"" in the spirit of keeping the peace.

I guess most of my anger is that if he were paying rent, or helping out around the house at all, contributing in any way, and I had agreed to be quiet past 8pm, I would find it reasonable, if extreme, that I'm not allowed to talk to anyone past 8, but as it is, he works because mom gave him an ultimatum a few years ago that he needed to find a job (with the understanding he'd help with rent or bills) or help out more around the house, and he chose to work, but he goes to work, earns a paycheck, contributes none to the household, and uses the job as both an excuse to not do housework and a reasoning for why he's better than me (again, I'm disabled, wheelchair bound when not bedridden, and still do what I can to care for the pets and clean the house to earn my keep). Sorry, this is turning into more of a rant than I intended.

So basically, I don't see a reason I should put my life on hold at 8pm almost every night, when he contributes nothing to the house, and especially when he's not tried exploring other ways to fall asleep that doesn't rely on my silence, like a white noise machine, or listening to music to fall asleep. Am I the asshole for not accommodating his need for silence?","NTA - In any MDU (multi-dwelling-unit) the tenants are entitled to the general sounds of life. If your life is watching a little TV past 8PM or spending time with a friend then he has no reason to complain. If you were throwing bangers every night it would be a different story. If your brother is working full time and he is unsatisfied with his living situation he should find a way to cope with that - as an adult. 

Let him know that you plan on living your life. If he can’t handle that then he can look into sleep-aids or other living arrangements.",NTA. Tell him to invest in a pair of fucking ear plugs and a white noise machine ,0,0
byboxc,"I was on the train between 2 major cities, it’s a 1.5 hour journey so obviously most people want a seat. If you buy tickets in advance you get given a seat reservation, but if you buy them at the station you don’t and you may have to stand if there’s no seats available. I’d booked a seat so I was all good. Usually when you get on the train there are little screens above each seat which say if they’re reserved but they weren’t working that day, and reservations still apply even if the signs are broken. 

Anyway, I’m on the train and this couple who’d been out shopping (had loads of bags from clothes shops) got on and sat down. A few mins later some people get on and politely ask this couple to move as they’re sitting in their reserved seats. Usually people just accept this and get up and move because they know they haven’t booked, but the guy from the couple asked to see this persons ticket to make sure it was actually their seat (wtf, who made you the ticket inspector) anyway, it was their seat and so reluctantly the couple move to some other free seats opposite myself and my partner. 

The train was filling up pretty quickly and I realised it was gonna be full, it was 5pm on a weekday so lots of commuters. A lady and her son come along, looking confused as there were people sitting in their reserved seats (this couple), they were clearly tourists so couldn’t really speak english and weren’t sure of the etiquette of how to ask for their seats. Eventually they realised that their seats were taken and so asked the couple to move, again this guy gets all rude like ffs, and asks to see their tickets. At this point everyone on the train is watching. The couple are complaining and swearing under their breath whilst getting up. The kid is just standing in the aisle looking awkward not really knowing what to do (standing a bit in the way of this guy but not massively)  and then:

HIM (rude guy to kid):  are you gonna fucking move then so I can get up

 This kid is literally like 9 years old

So I told the guy: you don’t need to be so rude

HIM: what did you just say to me

ME: I said you didn’t need to be so rude. He’s only a child and you were in his seat anyway

HIM: Oh for gods sake (walks off in a huff with his girlfriend)

They left all their shopping bags under the table and to be honest, although we noticed we didn’t say anything because he was being a dick.

When I told all this to my friend later she said that even though they were being rude it was bad of us to not tell them that they left their bags. Well I didn’t really feel like walking off after him after he was speaking to people like that so nah I wasn’t gonna tell him - karma for being an asshole.

(On mobile does sorry for any errors!) 

For my (f) 21st birthday, I went play mini golf with my older brother, older sister and my sisters boyfriend  in Manchester. 

Had a great time going round the course, there was two people behind us that appeared to be on a first date and a small family in front (a mum, dad and a 4 or 5 year old girl) 

So it was slow moving because the little girl took her time, we didn’t mind waiting as we were just having a good time. The girl from the couple behind us kept huffing loudly, under the breath complaints about how slow it was moving etc every time she had to wait. We let her go I front of us, and the family did as well so they didn’t have to wait.

Well as she walked past I let out a silent fart, not realising it would be rank. The girl walked straight through it and spread the smell, everyone could smell it - my brother swears he could taste it. It was toxic. 

Now the part where I may have been a dick, the little girl goes “ewwww ” then points to the woman who just walked past from the couple and goes “mummy I think she filled her nappy” and the guy from the couple stepped back to look down at her arse. 

That was it, we were laughing, the family was laughing, I was crying. The girl was trying defend herself saying it wasn’t her, her boyfriend was saying “everyone does it! You shouldn’t be ashamed” and the girl was denying it before storming out.

Now I could have stepped up and admitted it was me, but I was laughing at the situation so I didn’t.

azf3ye,"I work at a special needs school for children with autism and developmental delays, Im a TA and have worked here for years. Let me say I LOVE my job and LOVE the kids at our school.

Theres this one kid, pretty high functioning, and he's 17. (Hes also like 6'3"" 230 and is pretty built) This kid arbitrarily sorts people into good and evil the first time he sees a new person. There is no rhyme or reason to this. He is super friendly and nice to the good people. He likes to scream at and attack evil people because as he says ""Its fun!"".

This applies to staff and other students. He's kicked a 7 year old before, because the 7 year old said ""hi"" to him and he didn't like him.

On friday, this kid attacked one of his TAs in the morning, he was restrained, and seemed to settle down as the day went one. Later that day, at lunch, he began hitting another staff with his plastic lunch tray. As staff went to restrain him again, in the process he bit off a decent part of a staff member's finger.

dkyd1o,"My fiance and I got engaged in March last year and started planning the wedding a month later. Neither of us have huge lists of extended friends/family and we didn't like any of the venues around our town so we decided to have a destination wedding. This was something we consulted many people on, as we're aware of the stigma associated with destination weddings - that they're exclusionary in particular. We had a few people tell us they wouldn't be able to make it if that's what we wanted to do but about 80% of people said they could/would, so we started booking things and making arrangements.

Fast forward to now, when flights are now coming out and the RSVP date is next month (wedding is in October 2020). I've been following up on people just to make sure the ones who initially agreed and said they'd come are still willing/able to. To my surprise, most of the people on my side are now saying they can't. Some I believe are for genuine reasons (ie- buying a house, changing careers, pregnant) and then there are the not so genuine reasons of just not feeling like it anymore. From the start I've tried to be understanding and as inclusive as possible, and when these people told me they were no longer coming I was polite and said I understood, no hard feelings, etc.

It didn't actually start to bother me until I realised my fiance's tally for her side of friends/family and pretty much all of them who said they'd come are still coming. Moreover, she ended up inviting a few extra people, and some of her family members are asking us if other extended family (people we've only met like twice ever) can come because they are really keen to. I don't have an issue with more people on her side coming - I think it's great, but the disparity in the guest list is starting to bother me. I never wanted to be that entitled jerk that expects his friends/family to fork out thousands of dollars to come to their wedding, but when I see people who barely know me super excited and happy to come, it's kind of making me wonder why my side can't show the same degree of enthusiasm.
