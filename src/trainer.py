Train the model to predict the causal effect where text is the intervention.

1. run the outcome predictor with 5-fold splitting and predict the outcome for all training data
2. run the propensity predictor with 5-fold splitting and predict the outcome for all training data
3. compute the effect using doubly robust
4. train the effect_predictor using story + comment as input, and the effect from dobuly robust as the outcome
